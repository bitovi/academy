    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this section, you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>About Continuous Exploration, a process for identifying which features best
serve a product and its customers.</li>
<li>How the Continuous Evaluation workflow fits within the overall Continuous Exploration process.</li>
<li>Learn the basic flow of Continuous Evaluation and how it maps to the Jira board we will be using.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, maybe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup time with your team to use the exploration board</li>
<li>Share the process with your team X</li>
</ul>
<h2>Continuous Exploration</h2>
<p><img src="../static/img/program-management-with-jira/departments.png"
style="min-width: 400px; width: 100%; max-width: 800px"/></p>
<p>Continuous Exploration is the process of determining which features should be built to
maximize product value and customer success.  The output of the Continuous Exploration
process is the <strong>product backlog</strong> - a prioritized list of features that represents
the product team's best guess at how they will achieve their target outcomes.</p>
<p>Continuous Exploration is a term popularized by
<a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/continuous-exploration/">Scaled Agile</a>. The following
is their definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuous Exploration (CE) is the process that drives innovation and fosters alignment on what should be built by continually exploring market and customer needs, and defining a Vision, Roadmap, and set of Features for a Solution that addresses those needs.
Â© Scaled Agile, Inc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitovi's continuous exploration process is represented by the following two combined workflows:</p>
<p><img src="../static/img/program-management-with-jira/continuous-exploration-workflow.png"
style="border: solid 1px black; min-width: 400px; width: 100%; max-width: 800px"/></p>
<p>The <strong>Discovery Workflow</strong> looks at data, analytics, customer feedback and competitor research
to source <em>strong</em> feature ideas.</p>
<p>The <strong>Evaluation Workflow</strong> gets alignment on what the
feature represents and evaluates the costs and benefits of the idea.</p>
<p>Often, these workflows are shared partially across 2 individuals that cooperate closely together:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Product Manager, Product Owner, or Product Researcher - responsible
for the <strong>Discovery Workflow</strong> and helps evaluate the benefit. They are doing customer
research, surveying customers, constantly looking at analytics.</p></li>
<li><p>A Program Manager, Delivery Manager or Technical Product Owner (TPO) - responsible for managing how and when features get built. They help define the requirements, and work with engineering teams to estimate work. They also report on the progress of the work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Discovery Workflow</strong> is out of the scope of this training. This training is largely
focused on the Program Manager, Delivery Manager, or TPO role. So,
we will focus on the <strong>Evaluation workflow</strong>.</p>
<h2>Evaluation Workflow</h2>
<p>The evaluation workflow's goal is to produce a prioritized list of features that represents
the product team's best guess at how they will achieve their target outcomes. This best guess is
often called the <strong>product backlog</strong>.  In summary, there are four broad steps to produce a prioritized list of features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define what the feature is.</li>
<li>Evaluate and validate the feature's benefits.</li>
<li>Estimate the feature's costs.</li>
<li>Rank the feature against other features.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next page, step of the tutorial, an exploration board and workflow to help us manage this process.</p>
<h2>Exploration Board Overview</h2>
<p>In the next lesson, we will be setting up a Board in Jira to manage
the exploration process. Let's take a look at it now to get a sense of it.</p>
<p>It first starts with an ideas space.  This is the <code>backlog</code> below:</p>
<p><img src="../static/img/program-management-with-jira/exploration-backlog.png"
style="border: solid 1px black; max-width: 1000px;"/></p>
<p>Team members add their rough ideas into <code>backlog</code>. This should be prioritized with the
strongest ideas at the top.</p>
<p>Once the team has capacity to explore new work, they move those features into
<code>refinement</code>.  Anything added to <code>refinement</code> above automatically gets added to
<code>refinement</code> the board below:</p>
<p><img src="../static/img/program-management-with-jira/exploration-board.png"
style="border: solid 1px black; max-width: 1000px;"/></p>
<p>This board tracks features as they progress from rough ideas to implemented
features available to customers. The following summarizes each column:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Refinement</code> - The <em>PM</em> is working to define the goals of the feature and its specific requirements.</li>
<li><code>Refined</code> - The feature is defined well-enough for estimation and validation to begin.</li>
<li><code>Estimating / Validating</code> - The feature is being estimated or validated.</li>
<li><code>Ready</code> - The feature is <em>prioritized</em> and ready for development.</li>
<li><code>Development</code> - The feature is being developed.</li>
<li><code>QA</code> - The feature is being tested.</li>
<li><code>UAT</code> - The feature is being validated against users.</li>
<li><code>Done</code> - The feature was successfully released to customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><details>
<summary>Random Notes</summary></p>
<p>Once a feature is in <code>refinement</code>, the <em>PM</em> works to define the goals of the feature
and its specific requirements.</p>
<p>To produce that prioritized list of features ...</p>
<p>First, you must come to a rough agreement on what the feature is.  It's impossible
to compare different features unless the team has a sense of what the feature is.</p>
<p>Next, you must perform a cost / benefit assessment so that you can compare features
against each other.</p>
<p>There are multiple approaches for performing cost / benefit analysis. Some examples:</p>
<p>Benefit analysis mostly out of scope of this training.</p>
<p>Next, you need to estimate both:
the value of the feature and the co</p>
<p>you first need to</p>
<ul>
<li>Come to a rough agreement on what the feature is an is not.</li>
</ul>
<p>One you have this rough agreement established, you can do a cost / benefit assessment:</p>
<p>figure out what
the suggested feature is.  Once you have this, you can do a cost/benefit assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>A place to explore the ideas/features that lead to what we need.</p>
<p>We call those ideas &quot;initiatives&quot;.</p>
<p>It's important to be able to track this. It's important that it's a continuous process.</p>
<p>It's important that it provides visibility.</p>
<p>A workflow.</p>
<p></details></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We might want to be consistent with naming (Refining / Developing)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Exercise: Share the Workflow</h2>
<p>If you created a project wiki, the following document shares the process.</p>
