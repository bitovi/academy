    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>It’s difficult to give a training!</p>
<p>Trainings are intense. They usually
are performed contiguously, forcing trainees to continually learn
in a very rapid manner.</p>
<p>Trainees have a variety of experience.  It’s hard to make trainings
interesting and informative for everyone.  Experienced people might
find it boring and inexperienced people might find it too difficult.</p>
<p>This course will try to solve these problems so you can
have a successful training.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-weeks-before-the-training">In the weeks before the training</h2>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox"/> Confirm the date, time and location of the meeting space.</li>

<li><input type="checkbox"/> Make sure there is a projector and screen.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox"/> Send an email to trainees, reminding them:

<li>When to be there</li>
<li>Where it is</li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Introduce yourself and the plan for the week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share a link to the training material.</li>
<li>Get people in slack.</li>
<li>Get people installing anything they need.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Let people know that the training will be hard
and that they should ask questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week will be hard. There’s a lot to learn about X, Y, Z.
Some of you might find it very challenging, others might find it boring.
To those who find it boring, this can be a great time to spread knowledge
around, share your knowledge.  Help other people.  And even
learn how we give this training so you can use it to teach others.
(All this material is available online.)</p>
<p>The most important thing is to ask questions. There are
no stupid questions.  In fact, I think my strength as a developer
is entirely built around being unafraid to get help and ask questions.
I’ll happily repeat myself in different ways to explain something better.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Get introductions from the trainees.</p>
<p>Go around and ask trainees name, what they want to learn,
where they are from, and something fun about them. Write down their names.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="while-training">While Training</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bring the energy! Training can be long and tiresome. We need to keep it
exciting.  Lame jokes are better than boring.</li>
<li>Repeatedly ask &quot;Does anyone need help?&quot;</li>
<li>Set a timer for exercises.
<ul>
<li>Pass out cups, have people flip them over when they complete an
exercise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create issues when mistakes or improvements can be made.</li>
<li>Take pictures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finishing-the-training">Finishing the training</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask people to provide feedback <code>contact@bitovi.com</code> or issues.</li>
<li>Ask people if there are other trainings they would like.</li>
<li>Ask people for testimonials.</li>
<li>Ask people to recommend these trainings to other colleges if they
enjoyed the training.</li>
