@description Why Angular is a great choice for modern web application development.

## Angular in the Modern Web Development Ecosphere

Angular was first released in 2010 as a new framework in the MV\* space alongside libraries like Backbone, Knockout, and Dojo.
Some of the best things about Angular are that it is opinionated, has built-in testing, streamlines the Webpack build complexity with its own CLI, and is a Google-backed and supported product.

## The Pros

### 1. An Opinionated Framework

Developers have to make a lot of decisions on a daily basis, which can often create decision fatigue. The great part about using an opinionated framework is being able to shift your focus from build configs, high level architecture decisions, to writing the actual client-specific functioning pieces of the application.

The use of TypeScript to force type checking improves workflow by catching errors at compile time allowing teams to catch potential errors much faster.

### 2. Testing Built In

Spinning up a new Angular Workspace automatically creates a test suite, with a working karma config, and new test spec files for any component generated.

### 3. Harnesses the Power of Modern Bundlers

Angular streamlines the build process by masking bundler complexity with the Angular CLI.

Up until Angular 16, Angular's build process used Webpack. Webpack is a module bundler that also handles transforming resources, like Less or Typescript.

Starting on Angular 17, to keep up with latest technology and for its improved build times, Angular switched to esbuild by default.

### 4. Google-Backed and Supported Product

Having a heavy hitting tech titan backing a library can make it a very sustainable choice to use.
