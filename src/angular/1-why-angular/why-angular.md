## Angular in the Modern Web Development Ecosphere

Angular was first released in 2010 as a new framework in the MV\* space alongside libraries like Backbone, Knockout, and Dojo.

Some of the best things about Angular are that it has an opinionated framework design, integrated testing capabilities, a streamlined build process through its CLI, and robust backing by tech giant Google. These elements combine to make Angular a top-tier choice for web developers.

## The Pros

### 1. An Opinionated Framework

Developers have to make a lot of decisions on a daily basis, which can often create decision fatigue. Angular reduces decision fatigure by including everything needed to build robust applications out of the box. This allows teams to concentrate more on crafting unique client-specific functionalities rather than getting bogged down by build configurations and high-level architecture decisions.

Angular’s use of TypeScript enhances developer experience by enabling early error detection and robust type checking, fostering a more efficient and error-free coding process.

### 2. Testing Built In

Angular's commitment to quality is evident in its built-in testing framework. Upon initiating a new Angular Workspace, developers are greeted with a ready-to-use test suite, complete with a configured Karma setup and test spec files for newly generated components. This seamless integration underscores Angular's emphasis on reliability and maintainability in web development.

### 3. Harnesses the Power of Modern Bundlers

Angular streamlines the build process by masking bundler complexity with the Angular CLI.

Up until Angular 16, Angular’s build process used Webpack. Webpack is a module bundler that also handles transforming resources like Less or TypeScript.

Starting on Angular 17, to keep up with latest technology and for its improved build times, Angular switched to esbuild by default.

### 4. Google-Backed and Supported Product

Google’s support for Angular is not just a stamp of approval; it’s a promise of sustainability and forward-thinking evolution. This partnership ensures continuous improvements, keeping Angular at the forefront of web development technologies.
