@description This guide introduces React, the things you should learn before approaching React, and some advanced React topics.

@body

Welcome to our React course! Throughout this course you'll be introduced to a number of fundamental and advanced React concepts, all while building out a tic-tac-toe game!

## Before You Begin

Before approaching React, you will want to have some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript. Specifically, you will need to understand functions, objects, and arrays. Additionally, you should be familiar with some of the more recent ECMAScript features, like arrow functions, let, and const. It is also good to have some familiarity with NPM, though it is not strictly necessary to begin.

You'll also want to fork/clone down a copy of the exercise repository used in this course, a tic-tac-toe game:

[https://github.com/bitovi/react-exercises]()

This is the codebase you'll be using throughout a number of the lessons to test your React skills.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitovi/react-exercises
cd react-exercises
npm install
```

### Advanced Topics

Before attacking other advanced topics, you should read up on composition and inheritance in React. Then you can see how React handles state and lifecycle callbacks. From there, you might want to read up on catching errors from children components, asynchronous code splitting, or step outside official features and see how most people handle application state.
