@description Learn how to write an app the React way. Learn what separates a beginner app from an expert app.

@body

These references are separated into 4 categories: a category for general guidelines, and 3 ranked categories in descending order of project impact. That is: items in first categories are more important to get right early on, either because they significantly inform project structure or because adding them after the fact is extremely difficult.

In general, each topic will be broken down into three possibilities: simple apps, which usually just use basic React options and not required additional files; medium apps, which will generally need an external library, but will be very straight forward to use; and advanced apps, tend to be much more complex and only needed by the most advanced applications. As a general rule, we recommend the use of the Medium option in the vast majority of cases. In some cases, there may be less than three options, usually because there is a community standard or the react-only option is not simple. Additionally, there will be some options not covered in this guide. This is usually because we believe one of the presented options is a better choice, or because it is too niche of an option for a general guide.
