## Course Status

This course is currently being authored.  The following are external
guides we find useful to learn React. 

## Before You Begin

Before approaching React, you will want to have some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript. Specifically, you will need to understand functions, objects, and arrays. Additionally, you should be familiar with some of the more recent ECMAScript features, like arrow functions, let, and const. It is also good to have some familiarity with NPM, though it is not strictly necessary to begin.

* [Basic JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
* [Introduction to ECMAScript 6](https://medium.com/sons-of-javascript/javascript-an-introduction-to-es6-1819d0d89a0f)
* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/)

## React Basics

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

You are now ready to begin learning React! The best first step in the official tic-tac-toe tutorial, which takes place entirely in your browser. Then you will want to learn about _Create React App_, the de-facto standard for creating your own React applications. At this point, you can build your own apps, expanding on your components and introducing form elements.

* [Form Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

## Advanced Topics

Before attacking other advanced topics, you should read up on composition and inheritance in React. Then you can see how React handles state and lifecycle callbacks. From there, you might want to read up on catching errors from children components, asynchronous code splitting, or step outside official features and see how most people handle application state.
