@body

This section provides practical techniques and best practices for various communication channels, including chat platforms, email, meetings, documentation, and feedback. By mastering these methods, you‚Äôll be better equipped to convey ideas clearly, manage expectations, and foster positive working relationships.

## Chat

Chat platforms are a key tool for real-time communication. However, using them effectively requires intentionality to maintain clarity, minimize disruption, and streamline collaboration. This section breaks down best practices to help you communicate efficiently, focusing on channels, mentions, threads, managing your availability, and more.

Clear and professional chat communication keeps teams connected and informed. By using shared channels, providing updates, and setting appropriate boundaries, you avoid confusion and maintain focus. This ensures that everyone stays aligned, especially in fast-paced client projects where quick decisions matter.

### Channels

Shared channels should be the default space for most communication. When conversations happen in the open, everyone can stay aligned and informed.

- **Use shared channels as much as possible:** Unless the topic is sensitive or private, default to shared channels so that others can benefit from the discussion or jump in if needed.
- **Pin important messages:** Keep key resources, documents, or recurring information pinned to channels for quick access, especially for onboarding new team members.
- **Proactively communicate absences:** If you know you‚Äôll be unavailable for an extended period (e.g. deep work), send a quick message in relevant channels to notify others and provide an alternate contact if necessary.

Best practices for setting up a channel:

- **Channel name:** Keep channel names descriptive and concise, so people can easily find the right place for discussions.
- **Topic and description:** Set a topic and description for the channel so it‚Äôs clear what the channel is for when people are searching.
- **Pin messages and use bookmarks:** Pin important messages or use bookmarks for quick access to key documents, links, or ongoing projects. Review pinned content regularly so it‚Äôs up to date with what‚Äôs currently relevant.

### Threads

Threads are an essential feature in Slack (and other chat platforms) that help keep conversations organized and focused. By containing discussions related to a specific topic within a thread, you prevent broader channels from being cluttered with unrelated messages, making it easier for everyone to follow the conversation.

- **Maintain context:** Threads keep all related replies grouped together, allowing participants to stay focused on a single topic without being distracted by other conversations happening in the main channel.
- **Reduce channel clutter:** When conversations spill over into a channel, it can become difficult to keep track of various discussions. Threads help compartmentalize topics, making the main channel easier to navigate.
- **Encourage participation:** Threads make it easier for team members to jump in or out of conversations when it‚Äôs relevant to them. By keeping discussions contained, people can follow along when they‚Äôre ready without being overwhelmed by messages outside their scope.

Best practices:

- **Always start a thread when responding to a specific message:** Whenever you respond to a particular message or topic, use a thread rather than responding directly in the channel. This ensures the original message and the replies stay connected and don‚Äôt get lost in the larger conversation. This also prevents unnecessary notifications and keeps conversations organized.
- **Encourage others to use threads:** If a conversation starts to unfold in a channel without a thread, gently remind others to continue in a thread. For example, you can respond within the thread and say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep this conversation in the thread to avoid losing context.‚Äù
- **Keep separate ideas in separate threads:** Don‚Äôt hesitate to break out separate ideas or subtopics into their own threads. Even within a single channel, multiple threads can exist simultaneously. By breaking ideas apart, you make it easier for team members to engage with the specific topics that are relevant to them.
- **Use threads to explore topics before moving to meetings:** If a discussion in a thread is becoming lengthy or is difficult to resolve via chat, consider scheduling a meeting to discuss the topic more deeply. This is especially useful when back-and-forth messaging is taking too much time. Once the meeting is completed, share meeting notes or a summary in the thread to ‚Äúclose the loop‚Äù and provide final resolution.

Managing and following threads:

- **Monitor threads you‚Äôre involved in:** Slack notifications will typically alert you when someone responds to a thread you‚Äôre part of, but in busy environments, it‚Äôs easy for important threads to get buried. Make it a habit to check back on threads you‚Äôre involved in, especially if you‚Äôre waiting for a response.
- **Turn off notifications for irrelevant threads:** If a thread has become less relevant to you, or if you no longer need to track it closely, you can turn off notifications for that specific thread. This allows you to focus on the conversations that matter to you without being constantly pinged by updates you don‚Äôt need.
- **Set reminders for important threads:** If you respond to a thread but don‚Äôt want to receive ongoing notifications, you can set a reminder to check back later. This is especially useful for lengthy conversations that don‚Äôt require immediate attention but need to be revisited at a specific time.
- **Close out threads when the discussion is complete:** When a conversation in a thread has reached a conclusion, especially after a meeting or final decision, consider summarizing the outcome in a final post. This wraps up the conversation neatly and provides closure for anyone following along later.

Handling complex threads:

- **Convert unresolved threads into meetings:** If a thread has too much back-and-forth or is becoming unfocused, it may be better to resolve the issue through a meeting. Threads are great for asynchronous discussions, but when they start dragging on without resolution, shifting to a real-time discussion is often more efficient. After the meeting, post the key takeaways or meeting notes back in the thread to ensure everyone involved has a record of the outcome.
- **Use threads for follow-ups after meetings:** Threads are a great way to follow up on meeting discussions. If you had a meeting about a project or issue, start a thread in the relevant channel to continue discussing next steps or to gather feedback from team members who couldn‚Äôt attend.
- **Create documentation from conversations:** When useful info comes up, write it in a wiki or other documentation tool. This turns one-off answers into long-term resources.

### Mentions

Mentions are a powerful tool for grabbing attention, but overuse can lead to notification fatigue.

- **Use mentions thoughtfully:** Only mention individuals directly when their input is needed.
- **Sparingly use group mentions like @channel or @here:** These alert everyone in the channel and should be used only for urgent or critical matters. Overusing them can lead to important notifications being ignored.
- **Tagging for priority:** When something needs someone‚Äôs attention, pair the mention with a clear message to indicate why it‚Äôs urgent and important.
- **Avoid @team-handles without DRIs:** Using a whole-team Slack handle without assigning a Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) can create confusion. Always clarify who is responsible for responding.

### Writing effective messages

How you craft your message greatly affects how it is received and responded to.

- **Reserve DMs for urgent or sensitive matters:** When possible, use shared channels to discuss topics that could benefit the broader team. This keeps everyone in the loop and reduces duplicative conversations.
- **Be clear and to the point:** Avoid starting conversations with [just ‚Äúhey‚Äù or ‚Äúhello.‚Äù](https://nohello.net/en/) Instead, get straight to the point. For example, instead of ‚ÄúHey, do you have a minute?‚Äù say, ‚ÄúHey, can you help with this task? I need advice on how to approach it.‚Äù *Note that this can also be a difference in communication styles.*
- **Urgency in DMs:** If something is time-sensitive, state upfront why it‚Äôs urgent, when you need a response by, and what will happen if you don‚Äôt hear back. For example, say ‚ÄúPlease respond to this question by 3:30 PM today or we will reschedule tomorrow‚Äôs production release‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlease let me know your thoughts on these options by the end of this week, otherwise we will be moving forward with option one.‚Äù
- **Reread before sending:** Always review your message before sending it to ensure clarity and neutral tone. Eliminate unnecessary jargon or complexity that may confuse the recipient.

### Reacting with emoji

Emojis can provide quick feedback or convey tone in an otherwise flat text-based environment. However, their use should be intentional.

- **Use üëÄ to acknowledge receipt:** If you‚Äôve seen a message but don‚Äôt have time to respond right away, a quick üëÄ reaction can let the sender know it‚Äôs on your radar.
- **Use üëç to show agreement or support in large group threads:** This can keep conversations moving without unnecessary clutter in large group threads.
- **Don‚Äôt assume everyone uses emoji the same way:** Emoji like üôè are used in a wide variety of ways, so be careful using them to convey meaning.
- **Avoid using emojis to communicate ‚Äúyes‚Äù unless specified:** Since emojis don‚Äôt trigger notifications, it‚Äôs better to reply with text unless the person has specified that an emoji will suffice.
- **Provide clear responses to questions:** Avoid using just a thumbs-up reaction as an answer when there are two or more options for moving forward.

### Status updates

Your status is a quick way to communicate your availability or focus to your team without sending explicit messages.

Regularly update your status:

- Update your Slack status to reflect your availability, whether you‚Äôre in meetings, focused on work, or out of the office.
- If you are going offline for an extended period, use a clear out-of-office (PTO) message with your return date to manage expectations.

Update your status when you are:

- **In meetings or Out of Office (OOO):** [Sync your status with your calendar](https://slack.com/help/articles/4412365549075-Automations--Sync-your-status-with-your-calendar) so your status is automatically updated when you are in a meeting or out of office.
- **Offline to focus:** Closing Slack to focus on deep work is great. Be sure to update your status to let people know why you‚Äôre offline.
- **Out on PTO:** Include your return date in your status, e.g. ‚Äúü™Ñ PTO, back on Thursday 2025-01-02.‚Äù

#### Setting status updates in communication tools to indicate availability

Using status updates in communication tools like Slack or Teams is a simple but effective way to manage expectations and prevent interruptions during times when you‚Äôre not available or need to focus.

- **Set your status to reflect your availability:** When you‚Äôre stepping away from your desk for a break, at lunch, or at the end of the day, set your status to ‚ÄúAway‚Äù or ‚ÄúOffline.‚Äù This signals to others that you‚Äôre not currently available and helps manage their expectations for a response.

- **Use ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù mode during focused work:** When you need uninterrupted time to concentrate on a task, use the ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù setting. This not only blocks notifications but also informs your team that you‚Äôre focusing on deep work. You can schedule ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù periods during your most productive hours to maximize efficiency.

- **Customize status messages for specific situations:** Personalize your status updates to give more context. For example, if you‚Äôre in a meeting, your status might read, ‚ÄúIn a meeting until 3 PM ‚Äî will respond afterward.‚Äù This helps others know when you‚Äôll be available and reduces unnecessary follow-ups.

- **Respect others‚Äô status updates:** Encourage a culture where everyone respects these status updates. If a colleague is in ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù mode, avoid messaging them unless it‚Äôs truly urgent. This mutual respect helps everyone maintain their focus and balance.

Tips and techniques:

- **Be consistent with status updates:** Regularly update your status in communication tools to reflect your current availability, ensuring others are informed and can plan their communications accordingly.
- **Use specific statuses for clarity:** Instead of just ‚ÄúVacation,‚Äù add details such as ‚ÄúPTO, back on January 2‚Äù to provide context on when you‚Äôll be available again.
- **Respect others‚Äô status settings:** When you see a team member‚Äôs status indicating they‚Äôre busy or offline, respect that and avoid messaging them unless it‚Äôs urgent.

Questions to reflect:

- In what ways can you improve your use of status updates to manage communication expectations?

### Scheduling messages

Maintaining boundaries and respecting others‚Äô work schedules is key when working across time zones or outside regular hours.

- **Schedule messages to maintain boundaries:** If you flex your time and work outside of normal business hours, consider scheduling your message so it appears the next day when your colleagues are likely to be active.
- **Follow-up timing:** If you haven‚Äôt received a response after 24 hours, consider a gentle follow-up. Adjust the timing based on the urgency of the original message.

#### Maintaining clear boundaries between work and personal time

It‚Äôs easy for work to spill over into personal time, leading to burnout and reduced productivity. To maintain a healthy work-life balance, it‚Äôs essential to establish and adhere to clear boundaries between work and personal time.

To prevent work from encroaching on personal time, it‚Äôs important to set clear expectations about when you‚Äôre available for work-related communication. Here‚Äôs how you can do that effectively:

<!-- - **Define standard working hours:** At Bitovi, you are expected to have at least TODO hours of overlap with your client. These are the hours when you are generally expected to be available for communication and work-related tasks. Ensure that these hours are communicated to clients and colleagues at the start of any project. -->

- **Establish a clear after-hours communication policy:** Non-urgent communication should be avoided outside of standard working hours. For example, emails and messages sent after 6 PM should generally not expect a response until the next business day. This policy helps protect personal time and reduces the pressure to be constantly ‚Äúon.‚Äù

- **Communicate exceptions clearly:** In cases where urgent issues arise outside of normal working hours, make sure there‚Äôs a clear understanding of what constitutes an emergency and who should be contacted. For instance, if a system outage occurs, it might be necessary to reach out immediately, regardless of the hour. However, these situations should be the exception, not the norm.

- **Set expectations with clients:** When starting a new project, clearly communicate your availability and Bitovi‚Äôs after-hours policy to clients. Let them know when they can expect responses and emphasize the importance of respecting these boundaries to ensure long-term productivity and quality of work. For example, you might say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm available from 9 AM to 6 PM, and I typically respond within two hours during these times. Outside of these hours, I‚Äôll address non-urgent issues the next business day.‚Äù

Tips and techniques:

- **Discuss boundaries openly:** Have an upfront conversation with your team and clients about your availability and respect for personal time, and encourage them to share their preferences as well.
- **Use delay send options:** Schedule emails or messages to be sent during regular working hours instead of immediately, especially if you find yourself working outside standard times.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you maintain boundaries between work and personal time in your current role?
- What strategies can you implement to make sure your work doesn‚Äôt infringe on your personal life?

#### Emphasizing the importance of disconnecting after work hours

Creating a work culture that values personal time is essential for maintaining long-term productivity and well-being. At Bitovi, we believe in the importance of disconnecting after work hours to recharge and avoid burnout.

- **Log off at the end of the day:** We recommend that you physically close your laptop and disconnect from work-related apps once your workday is over. This simple action creates a psychological boundary between work and personal time, making it easier to relax and recharge.

- **Model healthy behavior as leaders and peers:** Managers and team leaders should model this behavior by not sending emails or messages after hours unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary. When you respect these boundaries yourself, you set a positive example for your team, showing them that it‚Äôs okay to unplug and that their personal time is valued.

- **Address clients who expect constant availability:** If you encounter a client who expects you to be available outside of your defined working hours, address this proactively. You might say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed that you often reach out in the evenings. While I‚Äôm committed to supporting you, I also adhere to a work schedule that allows me to deliver my best during working hours. Let‚Äôs discuss how we can manage communication more effectively during the day.‚Äù Setting this boundary early helps manage expectations and fosters a healthier working relationship.

Tips and techniques:

- **Set a routine for disconnecting:** Develop a ritual, such as a short walk or closing your laptop, to signal the end of your workday and transition into personal time.
- **Lead by example:** If you‚Äôre in a leadership position, model the behavior of disconnecting after work hours to encourage your team to do the same.
- **Create clear boundaries with clients:** Establish clear communication boundaries with clients regarding after-hours contact, and provide them with alternative ways to address emergencies if they arise.
- **Watch for weekend communication:** Respect work boundaries by avoiding messages or task assignments that imply weekend work without prior discussion.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you currently separate your work and personal time?
- What changes can you make to make sure you fully disconnect from work at the end of the day?

### Reminding yourself

Slack reminders are a built-in way to get a notification about a message later.

- **Set reminders:** If you‚Äôre worried about forgetting to follow up on something, set reminders for yourself to check back in later. You can also use reminders when you‚Äôve turned off notifications for a thread but still want to stay in the loop.
- **Use reminders to stay on top of threads:** If you respond to a thread that‚Äôs very active and you know you will not need to respond quickly (e.g. you respond to a question in [#ask-help](https://bitovi.slack.com/archives/C0G43SWR3) and don‚Äôt need to be distracted by the other replies immediately), consider setting a reminder for the thread and turning off reply notifications.

### Structuring your workspace

To avoid getting overwhelmed by messages, take time to organize your workspace.

- **Group channels by priority:** Group channels that are critical or high-priority at the top of your sidebar so they‚Äôre easily accessible.
- **Leave channels instead of muting them:** Reduce distractions by leaving channels that aren‚Äôt relevant to you.
- **Bookmark important messages or threads:** If something is important but you don‚Äôt need to act on it right away, save or bookmark the message for quick access later.

### Profiles

Your Slack profile helps others quickly understand who you are, what you do, and how to contact you. Keeping your profile up-to-date is a small but effective way to improve communication and collaboration.

- **Use a clear and professional profile picture:** A clear headshot or other professional image helps others recognize you, especially when working with new team members or clients.
- **Add your full name, title, pronouns, and name pronunciation:** This helps everyone address you correctly and creates a more inclusive environment.
- **Set your preferred hours and time zone:** This is especially important for distributed teams, so others know when to expect responses from you.
- **Include your role and expertise:** Use the ‚ÄúRole Description‚Äù field to briefly describe your role and areas of expertise for external people.

### Chat etiquette and best practices

Maintaining a professional and respectful tone in your messages can prevent misunderstandings.

- **Be mindful of tone:** Text-based communication can easily be misinterpreted. Avoid sarcasm, be clear and direct, and always assume the best intentions when reading others‚Äô messages.
- **Reread before sending:** Before hitting send, double-check that your message is clear, concise, and free from unnecessary jargon. A quick reread can also help you spot any potential ambiguities in tone.
- **Use positive language:** Frame your messages in a way that fosters collaboration. Instead of ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do this,‚Äù try ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what we can do.‚Äù
- **Don‚Äôt delete messages after solving an issue:** Instead, add the solution as a follow-up message to maintain context and transparency.
- **Be mindful with private channels:** Avoid adding people unexpectedly to private channels. Check with them first to respect their preferences.
- **Avoid anxiety with clear requests:** When reaching out, say what you‚Äôre contacting them about instead of just asking, ‚ÄúDo you have a minute?‚Äù.
- **Keep your profile updated:** Ensure your Slack or team profiles have relevant contact details like your email.

Questions to reflect:

- Have you ever received a message without a clear deadline? How did that affect your prioritization? What steps can you take to ensure your messages include clear expectations?
- Think of a time when you didn‚Äôt receive a response in your expected timeframe. What could you have done differently to clarify the urgency or expected response time?
- When was the last time you reviewed the pinned messages in your most-used channels? What steps can you take to ensure the pinned content remains up-to-date and relevant?

<label><input type="checkbox" /> **Check the _pinned messages_ in the channels you frequent:** Remove any irrelevant messages and add any recent messages that you think would be useful for reference.</label>

## Email

Email remains a crucial tool for formal communication, particularly for conveying detailed information, following up on discussions, or coordinating with clients. Crafting and managing your emails effectively can make a significant difference in how your communication is received and acted upon.

### Writing effective emails

#### Subject lines

Your subject line should give the recipient an immediate understanding of the email‚Äôs content.

For example, ‚ÄúAction Required by 8/30 ‚Äì Update on Project Timeline‚Äù is more informative than ‚ÄúProject Update.‚Äù Aim for subject lines under 50 characters to ensure they aren‚Äôt truncated in inbox previews. Use action words such as ‚ÄúReview,‚Äù ‚ÄúAction Required,‚Äù or ‚ÄúProposal‚Äù to set clear expectations.

#### Structure your email

- **Introduction:** Begin with a brief introduction that states the email‚Äôs purpose.
- **Body:** Provide the necessary details in an organized manner. Bullet points or numbered lists can help present information clearly.
- **Conclusion:** Summarize key points or requests, and restate your Call to Action (CTA) to ensure the recipient knows what to do next (e.g., ‚ÄúPlease confirm receipt‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet me know your availability by Friday‚Äù).

#### Focus on clarity and brevity

- **Prioritize the main point:** If your email covers multiple topics, highlight the most critical message at the start to capture attention.
- **One point per paragraph:** Keep each paragraph focused on a single idea to maintain clarity.
- **Use headings for longer emails:** For lengthy emails, break up content with subheadings like ‚ÄúProject Overview‚Äù or ‚ÄúNext Steps‚Äù to improve readability.

#### Use the correct tone

- **Adapt your tone:** Maintain professionalism, but adjust the formality based on the recipient. A client email might require a more formal tone, while an internal email to a colleague can be more casual.
- **Mirror the recipient‚Äôs tone:** Consider aligning your tone with how the recipient typically communicates, while still maintaining professionalism.
- **Use positive language:** Even when delivering bad news, try to frame it in a positive way (e.g., ‚ÄúWe encountered a delay, but we‚Äôre working on a solution to get back on track‚Äù).

### Managing email communications

**Schedule emails for optimal timing:** If you‚Äôre sending an email that doesn‚Äôt require immediate attention, consider scheduling it to be sent at a time when the recipient is more likely to see and respond to it, typically during regular working hours.

**Regularly review and clean up your inbox:** An organized inbox helps you stay on top of important communications. Regularly archive or delete emails that are no longer needed and prioritize actionable items.

**Be responsive and timely:** Acknowledge receipt of important emails promptly, even if you need more time to provide a full response. A quick ‚ÄúThanks, I‚Äôll review this and get back to you by [date]‚Äù sets expectations and keeps the sender informed.

Tips and techniques:

- **Set a regular time for inbox maintenance:** Dedicate 15 minutes at the start or end of your workday to sort through your inbox, archiving emails that don‚Äôt require further action.
- **Respond to action-required emails:** If you get an email that asks for action, respond promptly or find the right person to respond if it‚Äôs not you.
- **Set expectations for response time:** If you know you can‚Äôt reply right away, acknowledge receipt and provide a timeframe for your full response, e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôll review this and respond by tomorrow afternoon.‚Äù
- **Use auto-responses when needed:** If you‚Äôre out of the office or unable to check emails for an extended period, set an auto-response to inform senders when they can expect a reply.
- **Leverage email scheduling tools:** Use tools like Gmail‚Äôs ‚ÄúSchedule Send‚Äù to time your emails without having to manually send them during optimal hours.
- **Avoid Mondays and Fridays:** Emails sent on Monday mornings can be overlooked due to the weekend backlog, while Friday afternoon emails might not be read until the next week. Mid-week mornings are often the most effective.
- **Archive, don‚Äôt delete:** For non-critical emails that might be needed later, consider archiving instead of deleting. This keeps your inbox clear while still preserving information for future reference.
- **Unsubscribe from unnecessary emails:** Regularly review your subscriptions and opt out of newsletters or updates that no longer provide value.
- **Don‚Äôt bother with labels:** ‚ÄúOrganizing your email is like alphabetizing your recycling.‚Äù - [Merlin Mann](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/6320e9c140fed17cddcaea546f748ace1119a8a7/wisdom.md#the-wisdom-so-far)

Questions to reflect:

- Have you ever experienced delays in communication due to not setting clear expectations for when you‚Äôd respond? How could you have handled it differently?

### Exercise: Email communication

#### Email 1

Consider the following email:

> I wanted to make sure we are all on the same page for the navigation projects being delivered. It was recently brought to my attention that the delivery dates for navigation are as follows:
>
> - Rates & Fees: ~June 27th
> - Report Overview: ~July 2nd
>
> It is my understanding that this is a polished UI experience with service integration, prepared for the next phase of testing. The team working on Report Overview is slated to meet their deadline, from the UI perspective and has already met many times with the business analysts to iron out specific details and behaviors. However, I am concerned that Rates & Fees will miss the June 27th deadline. Dedicated development started on Rates & Fees on June 2nd, with UI development starting June 9th. Dedicated development refers to team resources working full time on this project, not including Srini and I‚Äôs proof of concept.
> Starting development this late, does not give the required time for UI testing and verifying the business requirements in order to deliver a solid application. I had hoped that a missed deadline would not occur while I was assisting in development, but I must stress the importance on starting early. The delay in starting Rates & Fees has led us to this point.
> Note, I will continue to assist Sanjay in developing the UI for Rates & Fees, but would like to open a discussion on what steps we need to take to get this project back on track.

**What do you think the biggest problems are with it?**

Once you‚Äôve identified those problems, try to rewrite it to solve those problems.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

> I am concerned that Rates & Fees will **miss** the June 27th deadline.¬†**Let‚Äôs discuss how we can address this concern at today‚Äôs daily scrum meeting.**
>
> This is mainly due to the fact that full time dev didn‚Äôt begin until June 2nd, which doesn‚Äôt give us enough time for QA and verification. Unfortunately, I only learned about this deadline very recently, or I would have notified you sooner.

**Principles used:**

- Optimize for a short attention span (condensed from 5 paragraphs to 2)
- Don‚Äôt bury the lede (the point of the email is stated first)
- Use whitespace (separating the first sentence from the rest makes the point clearer)
- Use¬†bold¬†to emphasize the most important parts of your message (need to discuss this ASAP, so highlight the call to action)
- Exec summaries and calls to action (it‚Äôs clear what the next step is)

</details>

#### Email 2

Improve the following email:

> I felt that David wasn‚Äôt being very articulate as to why he needed access to Google Analytics so I gave him a call. I didn‚Äôt think he was being clear so I wanted to clarify with him before we made any decisions At first I didn‚Äôt quite understand his reasoning but after my phone call with him I changed my mind. I think it would be a good idea to give our designer access to Google Analytics. I think David would be more receptive to me and we could better communicate on issues and how to solve them.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

> I think we should give David access to Google Analytics. I think it would be a good idea for 2 reasons:
>
> 1. He would be more receptive if he could see how his work was affecting the site (such as testing out the conversion rate of design changes to the contact form, etc).
> 2. We could work better and at a faster pace when solving issues (For example, for the month of June, 87 people came to the Contact Us page but only about 13 people filled out a form. If David had firsthand access to this information, we could work together to debug that issue quicker).
>
> Do you agree?

**Principles used:**

- Don‚Äôt bury the lede (the point of the email is stated first)
- Use lists (the reasons are easier to see)
- Exec summaries and calls to action (the email is easy to follow)

## Meetings

Meetings are essential for collaboration, but they must be well-organized and purposeful to be effective. Whether you‚Äôre leading or participating in a meeting, the following strategies will help you make the most of this time.

Well-run meetings save time and lead to actionable outcomes. Preparing an agenda, staying on topic, and sharing notes afterward ensure that everyone leaves with a clear understanding of next steps. This level of organization keeps clients and teammates on the same page and helps avoid missed deadlines or miscommunication.

### Scheduling a meeting

- **Purpose:** What is the end goal you‚Äôre trying to achieve?
- **Attendees:** Who is required to fulfill the purpose of the meeting? For anyone that‚Äôs not required, consider sending them the meeting notes afterwards for any additional input.
- **Title and agenda:** Set your attendees up for success and reduce their anxiety. The title should clearly state the purpose of the meeting. The agenda should include additional information (see below).

Tips and techniques:

- **Use clear meeting titles and agendas:** Always include a title and an agenda when scheduling meetings to reduce anxiety and set expectations.
- **Incorporate breaks for longer meetings:** If your meeting will last more than an hour, schedule a brief break halfway through. This helps participants stay focused and engaged.
- **Match schedules to roles:** Be aware of the different time management needs of makers (developers, designers) and managers. Schedule meetings accordingly.

Questions to reflect:

- When was the last time you led a meeting? What worked well, and what could have been better in terms of preparation and planning?
- Think about a time when a meeting you attended was poorly organized. How did it impact your participation, and what could have been done differently?

### Writing a great agenda

A well-prepared meeting is halfway to success. Always share a clear agenda with participants well in advance. Clearly define the meeting‚Äôs objectives to ensure everyone knows what you aim to achieve.

- **Goals:** Clearly define the goals of the meeting and what you expect to achieve by the end. This helps keep the discussion on track and ensures that all participants are aligned with the meeting‚Äôs purpose.
- **Pre-requisites:** Specify what people need to do or think about beforehand.
- **Links:** Include any relevant documents or links that participants should review beforehand. Set up the meeting notes document before the meeting and include it in the agenda.
- **Other information:** Share the billing code, encourage video participation, etc.

Tips and techniques:

- **Encourage attendees to be on video:** Video helps build rapport and ensures more engaged participation. Mention in your meeting invite that video is encouraged, but also be respectful of participants‚Äô circumstances.
- **Be realistic about the agenda:** Prioritize the most critical items and be mindful of the time available. It‚Äôs better to cover fewer topics thoroughly than to rush through many without proper discussion.

### Running the meeting

**Set expectations at the start:** Restate the agenda, goals, and any ground rules around muting, hand-raising, having video on, etc.

**Assign a note-taker:** Designate someone to document key discussion points, decisions, and action items. This ensures there‚Äôs a clear record of what was discussed and agreed upon.

**Keep the meeting on track:** Lead discussions assertively but diplomatically. As the meeting leader, guide the conversation to stay on topic while making sure all voices are heard. If the discussion veers off-course, gently steer it back to the agenda.

**Use time management techniques:** Implement methods like setting a timer for each agenda item or having periodic check-ins to ensure the meeting stays on track and covers all necessary points.

**Drive towards actionable outcomes:** Meetings should result in clear decisions and next steps. Summarize these at the end and assign ownership for each action item, ensuring accountability.

Tips and techniques:

- **Practice active listening:** Show you‚Äôre engaged by nodding, making eye contact (virtually or in person), and summarizing what others have said before responding. This builds trust and shows respect for others‚Äô contributions.
- **Balance participation:** If certain participants are dominating the conversation, encourage quieter members to share their thoughts by directly inviting them to speak or asking open-ended questions.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you typically respond when a meeting discussion goes off-topic? Could there be a more effective way to bring it back on track?
- Can you recall a situation where a meeting leader either failed to engage or overly controlled the conversation? How did this impact the meeting‚Äôs outcome?

### Taking notes

Note-taking complements active listening by enhancing your ability to remember and act on key points discussed during a conversation. Clear and concise notes reinforce what was said and provide a record that can be referred back to, helping to avoid overlooking anything important. Additionally, effective note-taking shows accountability, as it indicates your commitment to following through on the actions and decisions made during the conversation.

Well-organized notes are not just a tool for personal reference ‚Äî they are important for clear communication within your team and with clients. By capturing key points, decisions, and action items, you help keep everyone involved in the project on the same page, which is necessary for successful follow-up and documentation. This is especially important in consulting, where clear, actionable records of client interactions are vital for staying aligned and meeting project objectives.

Tips and techniques:

- **Share your screen:** Showing the notes helps keep everyone following along.
- **Don‚Äôt transcribe:** Notes should contain key points, decisions, and action items.
- **Review at the end:** Before ending the meeting, review the notes and confirm that everything captured looks correct.
- **Send notes after:** Always share the notes over email, in Slack, etc. to inform others.
- **Prepare for the next meeting:** For recurring meetings, create the next shared notes document so people can add items before the meeting. For meetings like retrospectives, this is great because it encourages attendees to add items as they come up during a sprint.
- **Review your action items regularly:** Tools like Confluence make it easy to see all the incomplete action items assigned to you. For example, here are the [tasks assigned to you in Bitovi‚Äôs Confluence](https://bitovi.atlassian.net/wiki/home/tasks).
- **Clarify deadlines:** When summarizing action items, make sure to specify deadlines for each task. If the timeline isn‚Äôt clear during the meeting, follow up immediately to get agreement.
- **Use collaborative tools for meeting notes:** Instead of sending a static document, use a shared platform where all participants can add comments or updates. This makes the notes dynamic and allows for ongoing collaboration.
- **Recap meetings with summaries:** Send a brief summary after meetings and check for alignment to ensure everyone understands the same conclusions.
- **Share weekly documents in advance:** If your team uses a shared weekly document, create the new one right after the meeting so it can be updated throughout the week.
- **Revisit action items in the next meeting:** Start the next meeting by reviewing the status of action items from the previous one. This ensures accountability and continuous progress.

Questions to reflect:

- How effective have your follow-ups been in the past? Are there tools or methods you could adopt to improve this process?
- Think about a meeting where action items weren‚Äôt clearly defined or followed up on. How did this affect the project‚Äôs progress?
- When have you seen shared meeting notes contribute to better outcomes? How did the collaborative aspect help?
- How effective are your current note-taking practices in capturing key information? What improvements could make your notes more actionable?
- Think about a time when well-organized notes made a difference in a project‚Äôs outcome. How can you consistently take useful notes?

### Being a great attendee

**Respond to meeting invites promptly:** Indicate your availability and provide any relevant comments or concerns as soon as you receive an invite. This helps the organizer plan accordingly.

**Request an agenda if none is provided:** If the meeting organizer hasn‚Äôt shared an agenda, ask for one. This helps you prepare adequately and ensures the meeting has a clear focus.

**Arrive prepared:** Review any pre-meeting materials and complete any assigned pre-work before the meeting. This preparation enables you to contribute effectively to the discussion.

**Engage actively:** Participate in the meeting by contributing your thoughts when appropriate, but also respect the flow of conversation. Active engagement helps make meetings more productive and inclusive.

**Take notes:** Contribute to the notes being taken by the note-taker, or take your own notes on key points relevant to your role to make sure you‚Äôre clear on any follow-up actions you need to take.

Tips and techniques:

- **Notify meeting organizers before declining:** If you need to decline a meeting invite, inform the organizer beforehand and explain why.
- **Prepare talking points in advance:** Before the meeting, jot down the key points you want to discuss. This helps you stay focused and ensures you don‚Äôt forget important contributions.
- **Anticipate potential questions:** Think about the topics on the agenda and what questions might arise. Preparing answers in advance can help you respond confidently and quickly.
- **Be mindful of body language:** Even in virtual meetings, body language matters. Maintain good posture, nod in agreement, and avoid multitasking, which can be distracting to others.
- **Mute yourself when not speaking in meetings:** This minimizes background noise and distractions.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you typically prepare for meetings? Are there any steps you might add to enhance your readiness?
- How do you handle situations where you disagree with a point being made in a meeting? What strategies can you use to communicate your perspective constructively?

### Daily scrum meetings

Daily scrum meetings are essential for fostering team alignment and addressing critical updates. To make these meetings effective and efficient, follow these best practices:

#### Consider the format

- **Keep it brief:** Focus on the essentials ‚Äî blockers, key progress, and any risks or dependencies. Avoid unnecessary details to ensure the meeting stays short and actionable.
- **Adapt the frequency:** Align the frequency of meetings with the pace of the project. For fast-moving initiatives, daily check-ins may be necessary; for slower projects, consider fewer meetings, such as twice a week. Adjust as needed to suit the team‚Äôs needs.
- **Use written updates when appropriate:** For fully remote teams or teams working across time zones, written updates can save time. Provide meaningful descriptions (e.g., ‚ÄúWorking on issue #123 ‚Äì fixing bug in user authentication flow‚Äù) to offer clarity without requiring follow-up questions. Written updates can also be shared in advance or documented in a central repository for easy reference.

#### Trust dynamics

- **Low-trust teams:** In environments with lower trust, daily scrum meetings may require more detailed reporting. Team members may need to provide explicit descriptions of what was completed to ensure accountability and visibility. This approach can help build confidence over time as progress becomes clear and consistent.
- **High-trust teams:** In high-trust environments, daily scrum meetings often focus on addressing blockers, coordinating efforts, and aligning priorities rather than detailed reporting. The assumption is that team members are completing their work independently and effectively, which reduces the need for granular updates.

#### Prepare beforehand

- **Plan your updates in advance:** Take 10 minutes before the meeting to organize your thoughts. Focus on what‚Äôs most relevant for the team, ensuring your updates are clear and concise. Avoid wasting time by preparing your key points ahead of time.
- **Keep a daily log:** Maintaining a brief record of your work helps you recall progress quickly and share updates effectively during the meeting. This also serves as a useful tool for tracking overall progress.

### Exercise: Draft a meeting invite

Look back at the communication plan you wrote for the ‚Äúfundamental principles‚Äù exercise and the message you drafted for the ‚ÄúDraft a message‚Äù exercise.

Draft a meeting invite with this information:

- Title
- Required attendees
- Optional attendees
- Agenda

### Exercise: Meetings

You recently attended a meeting where you were asked to discuss a new feature on your project. You started on the work, but today at daily scrum meeting you learned another developer is working on the same feature. Furthermore, your project manager is asking you to attend another meeting today to discuss a different new feature.

**What can you do to make this meeting effective and to avoid this duplicate effort in the future?**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Send out an an agenda in advance of the meeting. Also, explain what happened with the confusion around the previous feature, and that you‚Äôd like to agree who will work on this feature at the meeting. During the meeting, ask clarifying questions about the new feature and who is expected to implement it. Offer to take ownership of the feature if appropriate. Take notes about all of this. After the meeting, send out a recap of what was discussed to all of those who attended, making it clear who will be implementing the feature.

**Principles used:**

- Come prepared (setting an agenda will make the meeting more focussed)
- State expectations explicitly (explaining the confusion from before will help clarify the expectation you want to identify an explicit owner)
- Take notes and send recaps (there‚Äôs no question of who will be implementing the feature this time)
- Take ownership (your initiative creates less confusion)
- State expectations explicitly (everyone knows that you own this feature)
- Just care (having a clear purpose to the meeting and taking ownership show your dedication to the project)

## Wikis

Clear and accessible documentation is essential for knowledge sharing within and across teams. It ensures continuity, enables smoother onboarding, and helps maintain a high standard of work by providing a reliable reference.

Confluence is a versatile collaboration tool that can significantly enhance communication, documentation, and knowledge sharing within your organization.

You can use it for a variety of purposes:

- **Onboarding materials:** Developing resources for onboarding new members and outlining standard operating procedures (SOPs) for consistent practices.
- **Meeting notes:** Recording key points, decisions, and action items from meetings and retrospectives for alignment and continuous improvement.
- **Project documentation:** Capturing all essential project information, including requirements, architecture, and decisions, to ensure continuity and clarity for current and future team members.
- **Brainstorming ideas:** Providing a shared space for team collaboration, brainstorming, and contributing to early-stage ideas.
- **Knowledge sharing:** Writing articles or guides to share domain knowledge, tips, and best practices within the organization or with clients.
- **Technical documentation:** Writing detailed descriptions of system architectures, processes, or components to keep technical stakeholders informed.
- **Dashboards:** Create dynamic reports that pull data from Jira to provide real-time project statuses and updates.

Wikis provide a central hub for important information, but they only work well when structured clearly. Using headings, templates, and concise language makes pages easier to navigate, while highlighting decisions and action items ensures key details don‚Äôt get lost. This clarity benefits everyone working on the project by providing a reliable reference point.

### Creating and maintaining accessible documentation

**Differentiate between permanent and ephemeral communication:** Permanent communication (e.g., project documentation, procedures) should be well-documented and easily accessible. Ephemeral communication (e.g., chat messages) is more transient and doesn‚Äôt usually need long-term storage. Identify what requires formal documentation to avoid information loss.

**Develop clear, concise, and logically structured documentation:** When writing documentation, be as clear and concise as possible. Organize the content logically, with headings and subheadings that make it easy to navigate. This helps readers quickly find the information they need.

**Keep documentation up to date:** Regularly review and update documentation to reflect the latest information. As projects evolve or new insights are gained, outdated documentation can lead to confusion and mistakes.

**Use consistent formatting and language:** A standardized format helps maintain clarity and professionalism across all documentation. Consistent use of language also helps prevent misunderstandings.

**Store documentation in a centralized location:** Ensure that all documentation is stored in a shared, easily accessible location. This could be a dedicated Confluence space or a shared drive. The key is that team members know where to find the information they need.

**Establish and maintain ‚Äúsources of truth‚Äù:** Identify and maintain key documents that serve as the definitive reference for important information. Ensure these are always up to date and clearly labeled as the source of truth.

Tips and techniques:

- **Assess your documentation needs:** Before starting, determine who will be using the documentation and for what purpose. This will guide your tone, depth, and structure. For example, if it‚Äôs for onboarding new team members, focus on step-by-step instructions and links to additional resources.
- **Leverage templates:** Use or create documentation templates that can be reused across projects. This ensures consistency and saves time. Include sections like ‚ÄúPurpose,‚Äù ‚ÄúSteps,‚Äù ‚ÄúDependencies,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù to maintain clarity and relevance.
- **Write with the reader in mind:** Use a ‚ÄúWhat-Why-How‚Äù format where you first explain what the document is about, why it‚Äôs important, and then detail the how-to steps or information. This guides the reader through the content more intuitively.
- **Set a review schedule:** Assign a recurring task to review and update documentation. This could be quarterly or after major project milestones. Involve team members in this review to gather different perspectives.
- **Use visuals:** Incorporate diagrams, flowcharts, and screenshots to complement written content. Visual aids often make complex information easier to understand and remember.

Questions to reflect:

- Can you identify areas in your current projects where more comprehensive documentation would reduce misunderstandings or repeated questions?
- How do you ensure that your documentation is understandable for someone who might not have the same background or expertise as you?
- What strategies can you employ to balance the time spent on creating and updating documentation with other project demands?
- Consider your role as a consultant working alongside a client‚Äôs team. How does your approach to documentation and knowledge sharing influence their perception of Bitovi‚Äôs professionalism and expertise?

### Purpose

- **Define the goal of each page:** Clearly state what the page intends to achieve with an ‚Äúexecutive summary‚Äù at the top.
- **Create specific and focused pages:** Avoid overloading pages with multiple topics; instead, split them into dedicated pages.
- **Use descriptive titles and headings:** Make it easy for users to find information by accurately labeling content.
- **Organize content hierarchically:** Structure pages in a logical order to reflect their importance and relationship.

### Clarity, conciseness, and consistency

- **Break down complex ideas:** Use subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to simplify information.
- **Include visual aids:** Add diagrams, images, or videos to complement text and enhance understanding.
- **Provide context:** Link to other pages or Jira stories to provide background information.
- **Avoid repetition:** Cross-reference other pages instead of repeating the same information.
- **Use templates:** Employ adaptable templates that can be modified as needed.

### Using Confluence effectively

**Edit pages for clarity:** Regularly review and edit Confluence pages to improve clarity, add new information, or update existing content. This way, documentation remains useful and relevant.

**Watch pages for updates:** Use the ‚Äúwatch‚Äù feature to receive notifications about changes to specific pages. This keeps you informed about relevant developments without needing to manually check for updates.

**Assign action items with @ mentions:** When documenting decisions or tasks in Confluence, use `@ mentions` to assign responsibility and set due dates using the `//` feature. This integrates task management directly into your meeting notes.

**View diffs to track changes:** Use the ‚Äúview diffs‚Äù feature to track changes made to documents. This allows you to understand how content has evolved and helps identify the rationale behind updates.

Tips and techniques:

- **Prioritize content hierarchy:** Organize content in Confluence by creating a clear hierarchy with parent pages, child pages, and related links. This structure makes it easier for users to navigate and find information quickly.
- **Archive outdated content:** Regularly move obsolete pages to an archive space to prevent clutter and ensure that only current, relevant information is accessible. Clearly label these as ‚ÄúArchived‚Äù to avoid confusion.
- **Foster a collaborative environment:** Encourage team members to comment on Confluence pages, suggest edits, or ask questions. This creates a dynamic space where documentation is continuously improved through collective input.

Questions to reflect:

- Are you consistently notified about updates that impact your work? If not, how could you better utilize Confluence‚Äôs features to stay informed?
- In what ways could your current Confluence documentation be more user-friendly or comprehensive?

### Exercise: Create a meeting notes page

In your Confluence space:

1. Create a new Page.
2. In the ‚ÄúMore actions‚Äù menu, click on ‚ÄúTemplates and import doc.‚Äù
3. Select the ‚ÄúMeeting notes‚Äù template.
4. Fill in the information to run a meeting related to your communication plan.
5. Assign Chasen an action item to review the page by one week from now.

## Choosing the best method

Effective communication requires selecting the appropriate tool based on the context, urgency, and purpose of your message. In consulting and team collaboration, this choice impacts clarity, efficiency, and overall effectiveness.

The following the communication tools that should be present on every project. With so many options, it important to pick the correct technology for the type of interaction you expect. Immediacy (as in how quickly you need a response) is the governing attribute for each tool. Below are a list of common tools used in today‚Äôs workplace in order from least immediate to most immediate.

- Wiki
- Email
- Chat
- Meetings

When deciding what tool to use, start at the top ‚Äî it is the most respectful of your recipient‚Äôs time. Most communications are informational in nature and should be documented (like in a wiki) or emailed. If using email to ask a question or to get a response, follow the [learn-technology-consulting/communication#business-writing business writing] principles outlined in [learn-technology-consulting/communication].

Choosing the right communication method ensures your message is delivered effectively. Sensitive topics might require a call, while persistent information belongs in a wiki. Understanding the strengths of each method helps you communicate efficiently, reducing friction and making collaboration with clients and teams smoother.

By understanding the strengths of each tool and using them appropriately, you can reduce friction, foster collaboration, and communicate more effectively with both clients and internal teams at Bitovi.

### Understanding each method

Each form of communication has its own strengths and limitations. It‚Äôs important to match the method to the message to make sure everyone involved is informed and engaged in the best possible way.

#### Wikis (Confluence, SharePoint, etc.)

Wikis are a great option for documenting information that needs to be easily referenced, updated, and shared in the future. When you create a wiki entry, you‚Äôre making it accessible to the entire team or company in a centralized way.

Use a wiki when:

- **Information is permanent or long-lasting:** Document policies, best practices, processes, and historical project information. This helps others find and link back to it later.
- **There is a need for collaboration and feedback:** Drafts, proposals, or documentation that need input from multiple people are ideal for a wiki. Collaborators can add comments and edits asynchronously.
- **You want to avoid redundancy:** If something is likely to be referenced often, writing it in a wiki can prevent it from being repeated across chat, email, and meetings.

Examples:

- A checklist for onboarding a new team member.
- Documenting a new process for code review or deployment.
- A project‚Äôs requirements that need regular updates.

Don‚Äôt use a wiki when:

- _Real-time conversation or quick feedback is required:_ A chat or meeting may be more effective for clarifying points in real time.
- _Urgency is high:_ If something requires immediate action, a more direct communication method should be used first, with a wiki entry as a follow-up.

#### Email

Email is effective for formal communication, non-urgent information sharing, and when a paper trail is needed.

Use email when:

- **You need an official record:** Sending emails can serve as documentation for shared decisions, agreements, or important project details.
- **There is no urgency:** When the recipient has time to respond on their schedule, email works well.
- **The reply needs to be well-thought-out:** If you need to clearly explain something or provide detailed information, an email gives the reader the space to understand without the pressure of an immediate response.

Examples:

- Providing a recap of a client meeting or a list of action items.
- Requesting input on a document that‚Äôs already been shared via a wiki.
- Sharing project updates with clients or stakeholders.

Don‚Äôt use email when:

- _Real-time feedback is necessary:_ Use chat or a meeting if a quick response is needed.
- _Details are likely to change frequently:_ In these cases, use a wiki for easy updates.

#### Chat

Chat is an excellent tool for quick, informal communication. It‚Äôs useful when you need an answer promptly or want to collaborate in real time.

Use chat when:

- **Speed is essential:** You need a quick answer or clarification that doesn‚Äôt require a formal email.
- **The conversation is short and involves a lot of back and forth:** Chat works well when you‚Äôre troubleshooting a small issue or brainstorming ideas with colleagues.
- **Building rapport:** Chat is casual and conversational, which can help build relationships, especially for remote teams.

Examples:

- Asking a simple technical question.
- Confirming meeting availability quickly.
- Providing a brief update or checking on progress.

Don‚Äôt use chat when:

- _Information needs to be preserved or tracked:_ If the content is important for the future, put it in an email or a wiki.
- _Complex topics need detailed thought:_ Longer discussions or multi-part topics should be documented in a more structured way, either in a wiki or an email.

#### Meetings (Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, etc.)

Meetings are helpful for conveying complex information, building understanding, and establishing relationships. They‚Äôre ideal when tone and nuance are key, or when collaborative decision-making is needed.

Use meetings when:

- **Body language, tone, and immediate responses matter:** If the subject is sensitive or likely to lead to miscommunication, face-to-face (or video) meetings help convey intent clearly.
- **The topic is complex or emotional:** Discussions around team dynamics, performance, or deep technical issues often benefit from a real-time conversation.
- **Building team rapport:** Meetings help humanize digital interactions, which is important for building trust, especially with new clients or team members.

Examples:

- Kicking off a new project with a client to set expectations and establish rapport.
- Resolving misunderstandings that emerged through chat or email.
- Brainstorming solutions to a problem where everyone‚Äôs input is valuable.

Don‚Äôt use meetings when:

- _The information could be shared asynchronously:_ If something is purely informative, consider documenting it in a wiki or an email instead.
- _There‚Äôs no clear agenda:_ Meetings without a well-defined purpose can be unproductive. Ensure that information has been shared in advance and use meetings only when discussion is essential.

### Key attributes for choosing

When deciding how to communicate, consider the following attributes:

- **Bandwidth:** Meetings provide the highest level of context (body language, tone), while email and wikis have lower bandwidth but allow time to think.
- **Pace:** Chat is fast, ideal for resolving small issues quickly. Wikis and email are slower, better for thorough understanding.
- **Synchronous vs. asynchronous (sync vs. async):** Meetings and chat are synchronous, requiring everyone‚Äôs availability. Wikis and emails are asynchronous, allowing flexible contributions.
- **Urgency:** Chat and meetings are good for urgent topics, while wikis and emails are for non-urgent or permanent records.
- **Complexity:** Use meetings for complex or sensitive topics. Wikis work well for complex content that needs structured documentation.
- **Communication styles:** Adapt based on the preferences of the people involved. Some people might prefer emails for well-structured thoughts, while others might lean towards chat for rapid exchanges.
- **Availability and working hours:** Asynchronous methods like emails and wikis respect varying schedules, making them suitable for teams across different time zones.

#### Sync vs. async

Synchronous communication allows for:

- **Immediate feedback:** You can quickly gauge reactions and clarify misunderstandings.
- **More personal connection:** Real-time conversations help build rapport and trust, especially when visual or vocal cues are involved.
- **Quick resolution:** Ideal for situations that require instant decisions or quick turnarounds.

Asynchronous communication allows for:

- **Flexibility:** Recipients can respond when it suits them, which is especially useful across different time zones or busy schedules.
- **Time to think:** Allows individuals to consider their responses carefully, which can lead to more thoughtful and accurate communication.
- **Documentation trail:** Creates a written record of the conversation that can be referenced later, which is beneficial for complex or ongoing projects.

#### Urgency

_When is immediate attention required?_ If the situation involves crisis management, an urgent deadline, or a decision that needs to be made immediately, synchronous communication is usually the best choice. For example, if a client‚Äôs system goes down, a quick video call or phone call can help coordinate a swift response.

_When is a delayed response acceptable?_ For non-urgent updates, informational messages, or queries that don‚Äôt require an immediate answer, asynchronous communication is typically more appropriate. For instance, sending a detailed email with a project update allows the recipient to review it at their convenience.

Tips and techniques:

- **Establish emergency protocols:** Clearly define what constitutes an urgent issue with your team or client, and agree on how these should be communicated, such as using phone calls for immediate attention.
- **Schedule regular check-ins:** Set up periodic synchronous meetings to address potential urgent issues, reducing the need for ad-hoc communication.

#### Complexity

_Simple vs. complex information:_ The complexity of the information should guide your choice of communication method. Simple, straightforward messages might be best handled through a quick chat or email, while more complex topics may require a detailed discussion via video call or a well-structured email.

_When detailed explanations are needed:_ If the message involves explaining project requirements, resolving technical issues, or discussing intricate designs, a more thorough medium like a video call or a comprehensive email with supporting documents is preferable. This way, all aspects are covered and allows for questions and clarifications.

_When a quick check-in or confirmation is sufficient:_ For status updates, quick confirmations, or yes/no questions, a chat message or brief email can suffice. These are ideal for keeping projects on track without requiring extensive time or effort from either party.

#### Communication styles

_Understanding your client or colleague‚Äôs preferred communication style and tools:_ Knowing which tools and methods your audience is comfortable with can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your communication. Some clients may prefer emails over chats for tracking purposes, while others might favor quick Slack messages for day-to-day interactions.

#### Availability

_Aligning your method of communication with their availability and working hours:_ Be mindful of the working hours and time zones of your clients and colleagues. For instance, if you know a colleague prefers to handle complex issues in the morning, try to schedule important calls during that time. Similarly, avoid sending non-urgent messages late in the day, especially if you know the recipient won‚Äôt be available until the next day.

#### Building communication strategy within teams

Creating a communication strategy within your team ensures consistency, reduces misunderstandings, and fosters a productive work environment. Setting clear norms and expectations for communication can significantly improve collaboration and project outcomes.

Tips and techniques:

- **Ask about preferences early:** At the start of a project or relationship, directly ask your clients and colleagues about their preferred communication methods and availability.
- **Respect personal work rhythms:** If someone prefers to do deep work in the mornings, try to schedule meetings in the afternoon. Understanding these nuances can significantly impr
- **Choose the right communication mode:** Remember that tone and quick follow-ups are easier in spoken conversations. Written forms can lack immediate context.

### When to switch modes

It‚Äôs often necessary to switch between communication methods to suit the flow of information and the needs of the project. Below are some scenarios for choosing or changing communication methods:

**When should a meeting be a wiki?**

- If the meeting is about sharing detailed information that doesn‚Äôt require a lot of discussion, it might be better documented in a wiki.
- If you can provide all necessary details in writing and allow feedback asynchronously, use a wiki instead.

**When should an email be a wiki?**

- If you find that an email chain is getting long and includes evolving details, it‚Äôs likely more efficient to create a wiki document. This will also help others who need the same information in the future.

**When should chat be a meeting?**

- If a chat conversation becomes lengthy or involves complex, nuanced issues, it might be time to schedule a meeting to save time and avoid misunderstandings.
- If a lot of people are chiming in with different opinions, a meeting can help clarify roles and align everyone.

**When should a wiki be a meeting?**

- When people struggle to contribute asynchronously, or decisions are taking too long, a meeting can help push things forward.
- If a document requires real-time collaboration, schedule a meeting to finalize it more efficiently.

### Exercise: Choose the best method

Consider the following scenarios and whether you would communicate them over chat, email, meeting, or wiki:
