@description Learn what to prioritize in technology consulting. Hint: It's not technology.

## Overview

There's __a lot__ that goes into building, marketing, and selling a successful
technology product. Understanding the relative priorities of these activities
can:

- Help get an entire team focusing on the most productive ways of adding value.
- Help teams in one area appreciate the efforts of other teams.

With that said, the following are the most important activities to get right:

1. Goals - Everyone should know what they are trying to accomplish.
2. Product Management - Processes add value to customers and work towards successful outcomes.
3. UX / Design - A user experience designed
   to add value for customers.
4. Tools and Technology - Tools support
   efficient delivery of the above goals.

While it might seem counter intuitive
that technology is the least important part of
technology delivery, the truth is, __technology is the least important aspect of technology delivery__.

How can this be? You might build a error free,
highly performant, extremely maintainable (flexible) application quickly, but consider what happens
to that application if the app:

- has a __terrible user experience__ - Users will be confused. The product will fail.
- is __managed poorly__ - Unless you are lucky enough to
  get the application right on the first try, you will
  be unable to respond to feedback and quickly iterate.
  The product won't improve and eventually fail.
- has __misunderstood goals__ - Progress will be chaotic,
  as team members work on their own goals.
- has the __wrong goals__ - Sometimes the product doesn't
  fit the market. No amount of technology changes that.

Despite all of this, technology choices are
__very__ important. Applications are built on code after all.
A slow application negatively influences user experience. An inflexible application won't be able to change direction.

## Video Evidence

In 2014, Bitovi performed a review of its clients against a
[checklist](https://github.com/bitovi/checklist) of best practices. While far from scientific, the following video goes through the results:

In short:

- A short time to delivery most strongly indicated success.
- It reaffirms the priorities listed above.
