@description Best practices for building rapport with clients.

@body

A large part of being successful as a consultant is building rapport with your client. If a client likes and trusts you, you will gain influence. The more influence you have, the easier it will be to impact key decisions at key moments. Building rapport is no different than trying to make a friend.

We're no experts at schmoozing, but the following are helpful tips towards building rapport with anyone.

## Face time

It’s 10x easier to build rapport in person than it is over the Internet. Yes, remote work is easier now than ever, but building a relationship is still much harder when you can’t see the other person.

We’ve found that meeting a person in the first weeks of a project makes the rest of the project go smoother. Find a way to meet in person whenever possible to kick off a project.

## Non-work bonding time

When meeting in person, use the opportunity to get to know the person outside work. Ask them to go to lunch, dinner, drinks, or coffee, just to get to know them.

While you’re there, try to learn 3 things about them not at all related to their career.

For example, Nikunj loves flying drones, he’s into home automation platforms, and he has an 8 year old daughter and a newborn.

## Bring snacks

Buy some healthy snacks, candy, or donuts and bring them into the office. Bribes work!

## Speak up about things that employees are silent about

Employees are often operating in fear. Fear of stepping on someone’s toes, getting reprimanded or fired, saying the wrong thing and feeling embarrassed, etc. Bitovi will never fire an employee for speaking truth to power, so take advantage of it!

Be courageous and speak out openly about the problems you see that stand in the way of success. Organizational problems, dogmatic process, bad UX, etc. Of course be polite and respectful, but don’t be afraid to say what’s wrong.

In the process of speaking honestly, clients tend to develop more and more trust in you, since you’re providing rare insights.

## Be playful to get what you want

When bureaucratic red tape stands in the way of progress, don’t take no for an answer. Humor can often be a way to be persistent without being annoying. For example, Justin loves to talk about the time he jokingly told a manager who claimed it would take 4 weeks to get a dev server that he would send an email to Steve Jobs asking him if he thought 4 weeks was an appropriate amount of time. Soon after, he got his  devserver.

Using humor in situations where you’re feeling frustrated and incredulous is often an effective way to get what you want while not making people hate you.
