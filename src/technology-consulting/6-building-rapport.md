@description Best practices for building trust and rapport with clients.

@body

A large part of being successful as a consultant is building trust and rapport with your client. If a client trusts and likes you, you will gain influence. The more influence you have, the easier it will be to impact key decisions at key moments. Building rapport is no different than trying to make a friend.

We are not experts at schmoozing, but the following are some helpful tips towards building trust and rapport with anyone.

## Face time

It’s 10x easier to build rapport in person than it is over the Internet. We’ve found that meeting a person in the first weeks of a project makes the rest of the project go smoother. Find a way to meet in person whenever possible, espcially for critical points in a project's lifecycle (e.g. the start of a project).

If you find yourself unable to meet in person, make time to have one-on-one's on a consistant interval, like once every one or two weeks. We have also found just reaching out pair for a second opinion leads to an increase in trust in you and your work output.

## Non-work bonding time

When meeting in person, use the opportunity to get to know the person outside work. Ask them to go to lunch, dinner, drinks, or coffee, just to get to know them.

While you’re there, try to learn 3 things about them not at all related to their career.

For example, Nikunj loves flying drones, he’s into home automation platforms, and he has an 8 year old daughter and a newborn.

## Bring snacks and swag

When traveling to a client location bring swag and buy some snacks and bring them both into the office.

## Don't force it

It takes a lot of work build and maintain a healthy working relationship. The first step was closing the deal, now you need to focus on raising trust and likeability and not loosing it.

Here are a few items that don't deserve their own section, but sometimes get lost in hustle and bustle of work. Don't forgot about being polite. "Hello", "Goodbye", "Good morning", "See you tomorrow" all go a long way in increasing the frequency of pleasant interactions. Pay close attention to hints of birthdays, weekend plans, kids, or things you might have in common. Anything that closes that gap between consultant and client increases likability and trust.

All in all, just care about your client and what interests them, and don't force it. Trying to force trust and rapport can actually cause the opposite effect.

## Speak up about things that employees are silent about

Employees are often operating in fear. Fear of stepping on someone’s toes, getting reprimanded or fired, saying the wrong thing and feeling embarrassed, etc. Bitovi will never fire an employee for speaking truth to power, so take advantage of it!

Be courageous and speak out openly about the problems you see that stand in the way of success. Organizational problems, dogmatic process, bad UX, etc. Of course be polite and respectful, but don’t be afraid to say what’s wrong.

In the process of speaking honestly, clients tend to develop more and more trust in you, since you’re providing rare insights.

## Be playful to get what you want

When bureaucratic red tape stands in the way of progress, don’t take no for an answer. Humor can often be a way to be persistent without being annoying. For example, Justin loves to talk about the time he jokingly told a manager who claimed it would take 4 weeks to get a dev server that he would send an email to Steve Jobs asking him if he thought 4 weeks was an appropriate amount of time. Soon after, he got his  devserver.

Using humor in situations where you’re feeling frustrated and incredulous is often an effective way to get what you want while not making people hate you.
