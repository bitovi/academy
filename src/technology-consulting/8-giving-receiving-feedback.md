@body

Feedback is a critical part of both individual growth and team success. When delivered thoughtfully, it helps build trust, improves performance, and enhances collaboration. Whether giving or receiving feedback, the way you approach it can make all the difference in its effectiveness. This module is designed to help you develop the skills needed to navigate feedback situations confidently and constructively.

## Giving feedback 

Delivering feedback with empathy and receiving it thoughtfully builds trust and encourages improvement. Taking notes and choosing the right time to share feedback ensures it’s constructive and actionable. By confirming understanding, you create a culture of accountability and continuous learning, benefiting your work with clients and colleagues alike.

### Before giving feedback

Before offering feedback, it’s essential to prepare thoughtfully. This means understanding both your intention and the potential impact of your words.

- **Look at giving feedback as an opportunity to help the other person grow:** The goal of feedback should always be to assist someone in improving or continuing positive behaviors. Think of feedback as a tool to help someone get better. Shifting your mindset in this way can make the conversation feel supportive rather than confrontational.
- **Continuously take notes:** Feedback is most effective when it is based on specific behaviors or instances. Keep ongoing notes about observations — both positive and areas for improvement — so your feedback is clear and well-supported.
- **Look for opportunities to reinforce positive behavior:** Don’t limit feedback to pointing out issues. Actively look for times when people are doing things well. Reinforcing good behavior encourages more of it and contributes to a positive work environment.
- **Consider the differences between actual problems vs. preferences:** It’s important to distinguish between what’s genuinely problematic and what is a matter of personal preference. Giving feedback on genuine issues is vital for improvement, but feedback based solely on preferences should be approached with caution — especially if it doesn’t directly affect team performance or outcomes.
- **Put yourself in the other person’s shoes:** Consider how the recipient might react. Reflect on their perspective, potential sensitivities, and how they are likely to feel about the feedback. This helps you choose your words carefully and deliver feedback in a way that is empathetic and constructive.

### When giving feedback

When the time comes to actually deliver feedback, clear communication and empathy are key.

- **SBI model:** The **Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI)** model is a helpful way to frame feedback. Start by describing the **situation** where the behavior occurred, specify the **behavior** you observed, and explain the **impact** it had. For example: “In yesterday’s client meeting (situation), you interrupted John several times while he was speaking (behavior). This made it harder for him to express his points and may have come across as dismissive (impact).”
- **Make sure feedback is timely and relevant to the context:** Feedback is most effective when it’s given promptly after the observed behavior. This makes it easier for the recipient to connect the feedback with the specific actions or events in question. Additionally, keep feedback relevant to the current context and priorities of the team or project. This helps in addressing issues before they escalate and keeps the feedback aligned with ongoing goals.
- **Offer specific, actionable, and objective feedback:** Avoid vague comments like “You need to be better at communication.” Instead, be specific and actionable: “When speaking with clients, try summarizing their points to show you understand before providing your input.”
- **Be mindful of tone:** Tone plays a huge role in how feedback is received. Aim for a neutral and caring tone. Even well-phrased feedback can be taken poorly if the tone sounds accusatory or dismissive.
- **Use “I” statements:** Using “I” statements can prevent the recipient from feeling blamed or attacked. Instead of saying, “You never meet deadlines,” try “I’ve noticed that some recent deadlines have been missed, and I’m concerned about how this affects our timeline.”
- **Frame feedback with empathy:** Feedback is most helpful when it comes from a place of understanding. Acknowledge the recipient’s perspective or challenges they may face, and let them know you are there to support their growth. “I know the new process can be challenging, but I believe this feedback will help in making it easier over time.”
- **Check for understanding:** Before concluding the feedback discussion, ask the recipient if they have understood the key points. This could be as simple as saying, “Do you feel clear on what I’ve shared?” or “Do you have any questions about what I’ve said?” This helps avoid misunderstandings and opens the door for clarifications.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you usually feel when receiving feedback? How might this influence how you give feedback?
- How do you ensure that your feedback is perceived as constructive rather than critical?

- Think of a time when you received feedback that was either very effective or ineffective. What made it so, and how can you apply those insights to how you give feedback?
- How do you adapt your feedback style based on the individual you are communicating with? Are there ways you could further refine this approach?
- Consider a recent situation where you gave feedback. What was the impact of that feedback, and how could you have framed it differently for a better outcome?

### After giving feedback

Feedback shouldn’t end when the conversation does. Following up can be just as important as delivering the feedback.

- **Follow-up on feedback:** Set a reminder to check in after some time has passed. Ask if they have any questions or if they need more support. This shows that you care about their progress and are invested in their success.
- **Offer ways to help:** If the feedback points to areas of improvement, be prepared to offer ways you can help. For example, you might offer additional resources, provide coaching, or make time for extra check-ins.
- **Acknowledge progress:** After giving feedback, make it a point to recognize any improvements, even small ones. This encourages the recipient and shows that you notice their efforts. For instance, saying, “I’ve seen a real improvement in the way you communicate your ideas in meetings lately — great work on applying that feedback” reinforces positive change.

## Receiving feedback

### Asking for feedback

Proactively seeking feedback shows a commitment to self-improvement and openness. It also encourages a culture where feedback flows both ways, making everyone feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts.

- **Seek out feedback proactively:** Don’t wait for formal reviews to ask for feedback. Ask colleagues, clients, or supervisors regularly how you’re doing, and if there’s anything you can do differently or better. You might say, “I’d really appreciate your thoughts on how I handled that client meeting. Was there anything I could improve?”
- **Frame your request positively:** Make it clear that you’re open to all types of feedback. A good way to do this is by saying, “I’m looking for ways to improve, and I would really value your honest input.” This sets the expectation that you’re genuinely interested in growing and encourages others to be candid.
- **Be specific in your request:** Instead of asking for general feedback, be clear about what you want input on. For example, you could say, “Can you give me some feedback on how I handled the project kickoff meeting?” This helps the person giving feedback focus their response and makes it more useful for you.
- **Ask different people for feedback:** Diversify the perspectives you get by asking for feedback from people with different working relationships with you. A colleague may offer insights into your teamwork skills, while a manager can provide feedback on strategic decision-making. Each perspective can help you understand your performance more fully.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you choose who to ask for feedback? Are you getting a balanced perspective?
- What’s one area of communication where you feel you need external validation or critique?

### When receiving feedback

Receiving feedback effectively requires an open mind and a willingness to grow. This can sometimes be challenging, but there are ways to make it easier.

- **Use active listening techniques:** When receiving feedback, show that you are listening by maintaining eye contact, nodding, and using phrases like “I see” or “I understand.” This helps the other person feel heard and makes it easier for you to absorb the feedback.
- **It’s natural to feel defensive or emotional, so breathe and remember it’s not about you personally, it’s about growing professionally:** Feedback can stir up emotions, especially if it feels critical. Remind yourself that feedback is about the work, not you as a person. Taking a breath and focusing on the message rather than the delivery can help manage these feelings.

- **Pause before responding:** It’s okay to take a moment before responding to feedback. Pausing helps you avoid reacting defensively and gives you time to consider what’s being said.
- **Seek examples to understand feedback better:** If the feedback is unclear or too general, ask for specific examples. This helps you understand what actions or behaviors to adjust.
- **Express appreciation for feedback:** Regardless of how the feedback makes you feel, thank the person for their time and effort. A simple “Thanks for taking the time to share this with me” can help foster a positive environment for open communication.

Questions to reflect:

- When was the last time you received feedback that was hard to hear? How did you handle it, and what did you learn?
- In what ways could you improve your receptiveness to feedback?

- When receiving feedback, how do you typically respond, and what impact does this have on your growth? Are there any habits you’d like to change?
- Reflect on a time when you struggled to accept feedback. What made it difficult, and how could you approach similar situations differently in the future?
- What steps can you take to make sure you actively apply feedback rather than just acknowledging it? How can you measure your progress over time?

### After receiving feedback

The work doesn’t stop after you’ve received feedback — what you do with it is what makes a difference.

- **Seek additional perspectives:** Sometimes it’s helpful to get a second opinion, especially if feedback seems unexpected or unclear. Ask a trusted colleague for their perspective to get a fuller picture.
- **Turn feedback into actionable steps:** Break down the feedback into specific actions. For example, if you were told to improve communication in meetings, an action step might be “Summarize key points at the end of each meeting to ensure clarity.”
- **Create a system for measuring progress:** Set up a way to track your progress. This could be as simple as writing down your goals and checking in weekly or asking for feedback from a trusted colleague to see if they’ve noticed improvements.

## Self-assessment and reflection

Self-assessment and reflection are powerful tools for personal development. By regularly evaluating your own communication skills and reflecting on past experiences, you can identify strengths, recognize areas for improvement, and set goals for growth.

**Conducting regular self-assessments to identify strengths and areas for improvement in communication:** Regularly take the time to assess your communication skills. Consider your interactions with colleagues and clients, and identify areas where you excel and where you might need improvement. For instance, you might notice that you’re strong in written communication but could improve in public speaking or active listening. This self-awareness is the first step toward meaningful improvement.

**Reflecting on past interactions to learn from successes and mistakes:** Reflection involves looking back on past interactions and analyzing what went well and what could have been better. Consider both successful communications and those that were less effective. What factors contributed to the success or failure? What can you learn from these experiences? This reflection helps you understand the dynamics of communication and how you can apply these lessons in the future.

**Setting specific goals for improving communication skills based on self-assessment and feedback received:** Based on your self-assessment and the feedback you’ve received, set specific, measurable goals for improvement. For example, if you’ve identified that you need to improve your public speaking skills, you might set a goal to practice speaking in meetings or to attend a public speaking workshop. These goals should be realistic and achievable, allowing you to track your progress over time.

**Using self-reflection tools such as journaling or feedback logs to track development over time:** Tools like journaling or maintaining a feedback log can be invaluable in tracking your development. Regularly write down your thoughts on your communication experiences, noting any feedback received and your reflections on it. Over time, these records can help you see patterns in your communication, track your progress, and identify areas where you’ve improved or need further development.

Tips and techniques:

- **Set a regular self-review schedule:** Allocate time at the end of each week or month to review your communication efforts. Look at what went well and where you struggled.
- **Use a communication journal:** Document interactions that stood out to you, noting what you did well and where there was room for improvement. Reflect on these entries periodically.
- **Compare current skills with past experiences:** Look back at old projects or communications to see how your skills have evolved. This can help identify patterns and areas still needing work.
- **Celebrate small wins:** Recognize the progress you’ve made, even if it’s minor. This keeps you motivated and aware of your continuous improvement.

Questions to reflect:

- How often do you think about your communication skills outside of formal reviews or feedback sessions?
- What recent communication success are you most proud of? What specific actions contributed to that success?
- What patterns do you notice in your self-assessment that might indicate an area needing more attention?

## Sustaining continuous improvement

Continuous improvement in communication requires ongoing effort and a commitment to learning. By embedding feedback and self-reflection into your daily routine, you can create a habit of constant development and improvement.

**Encouraging a habit of continuous learning and development in communication skills:** Cultivate a mindset of continuous learning. This means regularly seeking out opportunities to improve your communication skills, whether through formal training, reading, or simply observing and learning from others. Stay curious and open to new ideas, and be willing to experiment with different communication techniques to find what works best for you.

**Integrating feedback into daily routines and making adjustments as necessary:** Make it a habit to regularly seek feedback and integrate it into your daily routines. This could involve setting aside time each day or week to reflect on the feedback you’ve received and to think about how you can apply it. By consistently making small adjustments based on feedback, you can achieve steady, incremental improvements in your communication skills.

**Promoting a culture of open communication within teams to foster ongoing improvement:** Finally, fostering a culture of open communication within your team can contribute to continuous improvement for everyone. Encourage your colleagues to give and receive feedback openly and constructively. When everyone is committed to improving communication, the team as a whole becomes more effective, leading to better collaboration and outcomes.

Tips and techniques:

- **Start small:** Focus on one communication skill at a time rather than trying to improve everything at once. Small, consistent improvements are more sustainable.

Questions to reflect:

- What new communication skills have you recently started to develop, and how are you progressing?
- How do you integrate feedback into your daily routines without it feeling forced or overwhelming?
- What’s one communication habit you would like to change, and what steps will you take to address it?
