## Communication styles

Communication styles refer to how people express themselves, both verbally and nonverbally. Understanding these styles helps reduce misunderstandings and build stronger relationships with colleagues, clients, stakeholders, etc.

This three-part page explains how to [learn-technology-consulting/communication-styles#understanding-ourselves understand your own style], [learn-technology-consulting/communication-styles#understanding-others understanding others’ style], and [learn-technology-consulting/communication-styles#adapting-to-others adapt your style] to better suit the needs of others.

## Understanding ourselves

Understanding your own communication style helps you recognize how your communication is perceived by other people. Oftentimes, perception is reality. When you understand how you’re perceived, you can emphasize the parts of your style that are helpful in the moment, and be mindful when your default style might not fit the situation you’re in.

The overall goal is to understand our own style so we can make sure we convey the right message, regardless of the situation we’re in.

### Personality vs. behavior models

Personality models, like the Big Five, focus on traits that stay consistent over time.
They provide general insights into behavior but are less useful in predicting real-time communication.

Behavior models, on the other hand, focus on how people act in specific situations.
These models explain how people adjust their behavior based on the context.

- **Consistency across situations**
  - **Personality:** Traits are consistent across different situations.
  - **Behavior:** Behavior changes based on environment.

- **Source or origin of actions or tendencies**
  - **Personality:** Traits reflect inherent tendencies.
  - **Behavior:** Behavior is visible and measurable.

- **Predictability over time or in patterns**
  - **Personality:** They help forecast how someone will generally act.
  - **Behavior:** Behavior can change frequently.

- **Primary focus of the description**
  - **Personality:** Traits describe “what” a person is like.
  - **Behavior:** Focuses on how people act.

- **Adaptability to different contexts**
  - **Personality:** Traits apply broadly across contexts.
  - **Behavior:** People adjust their behavior to fit in.

Obviously, it’s not feasible to have every single person you interact with take a personality test. It’s also not as useful because people’s behavior changes depending on the situations they are in.

Behavior models that focus on actions that we can see are more useful in everyday communication because they offer a path to understanding what someone needs based on how they’re behaving.

The key benefit is their flexibility — allowing you to adjust your communication style based on the situation. If someone prefers concise answers, keep it brief; if they favor open-ended conversations, ask more questions. This adaptability smooths interactions and is especially valuable for consultants working with new teams and clients who need to build rapport quickly.

This table compares four popular behavior style models: Integrity Solutions’ Behavior Styles, DISC, MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), and Social Styles.
Each model categorizes individuals based on their communication, decision-making, and interaction tendencies.
While these models use different terminology and frameworks, they roughly align in their groupings of individuals by behavior.

### Understanding the spectrums

Both **direct vs. indirect** and **open vs. guarded** represent spectrums, not binary categories. People can shift along these spectrums depending on the context (e.g., work vs. home), the relationship with the other person, or the situation at hand.

- **Direct and indirect** refer to **how** people communicate — whether they get straight to the point or approach things more subtly.
- **Open and guarded** refer to **what** they share — whether they freely share personal feelings and opinions or keep them more private.

Each person may display varying levels of directness and openness, depending on circumstances:

- **Highly direct and open (Talker):** Tends to be very expressive, sharing opinions and feelings with little hesitation.
- **Highly direct and guarded (Doer):** Communicates clearly and assertively but keeps personal details private.
- **Indirect and open (Supporter):** May share personal experiences but does so in a softer, more cautious way.
- **Indirect and guarded (Controller):** Offers little personal information and communicates subtly, often prioritizing harmony and avoiding conflict.

These spectrums help us understand the nuances of communication and interaction in different settings, allowing for more adaptable and effective communication strategies.

**All four of the main Behavior Styles categories are present at Bitovi.** Each category has strengths that they bring to the table. Diversity in a team is useful because diverse communication styles can excel in different areas, so together they can be more than the sum of their individual parts.

### Direct vs. indirect communication

Direct communication is clear, straightforward, and often more assertive. People who tend toward direct communication prefer to get straight to the point, focus on facts, and may use a more confident or commanding tone. In a spectrum, this is one end, where clarity and brevity are highly valued.

Indirect communication, on the other end of the spectrum, involves more subtlety and nuance. Indirect communicators tend to soften their language, often prioritizing the feelings of others and context over the content of the message. They may avoid conflict by phrasing things gently or using hints.

- **Conflict handling**
  - **Direct:** May interrupt or take control of conversations to ensure points are made. Can come across as blunt or overly candid.
  - **Indirect:** Avoids conflict or confrontation by phrasing things gently or using suggestions. Reluctant to express disagreement or make demands.

- **Focus of communication**
  - **Direct:** Focuses on facts and logic rather than emotions. Prefers clarity and brevity.
  - **Indirect:** Prioritizes the feelings of others and context over the content of the message. Often hints at deeper meaning through tone or body language.

- **Tone and phrasing**
  - **Direct:** Confident or commanding tone. Assertive language that is action-focused.
  - **Indirect:** Gentle and nuanced. Frequently uses qualifiers like “perhaps” or “possibly.”

- **Decision-making**
  - **Direct:** Often quick to make decisions and take action. Prefers efficiency and dislikes small talk.
  - **Indirect:** Frequently seeks consensus or approval from others before making decisions. Prefers a slower pace of decision-making.

- **Pace of communication**
  - **Direct:** Prefers efficiency and a focused pace. Often quick to take action.
  - **Indirect:** Prefers a slower, more deliberate pace of conversation, taking time to consider the feelings and responses of others.

- **Language style**
  - **Direct:** Uses concise, straightforward language. Frequently uses strong, assertive phrases like “I want” or “I need.”
  - **Indirect:** Uses more polite, softened, or vague language, such as “Maybe we could” or “What do you think about…”

- Makes statements or requests without hesitation.
- Uses concise, straightforward language.
- Focuses on facts and logic rather than emotions.
- Frequently uses strong, assertive language (e.g., “I want,” “I need”).
- May interrupt or take control of conversations to ensure points are made.
- Often quick to make decisions and take action.
- Prefers efficiency and tends to dislike small talk.
- May come across as blunt or overly candid.

### Open vs. guarded communication

Open communication is characterized by a willingness to share personal feelings, opinions, and information. People who are more open tend to be transparent and expressive, comfortable with revealing their thoughts and experiences. On a spectrum, this represents individuals who are easy to “read” and who value openness in others.​

Guarded communication, on the other end of the spectrum, reflects a more private or reserved approach. People who are guarded often keep personal information to themselves, are more selective in what they share, and may appear more cautious or detached.

- **Sharing personal information**
  - **Open:** Freely shares personal information and experiences.
  - **Guarded:** Rarely shares personal thoughts or feelings.

- **Emotional expression**
  - **Open:** Expresses emotions openly and comfortably.
  - **Guarded:** Reserved and avoids discussing emotions or deep topics.

- **Feedback and input**
  - **Open:** Frequently asks for feedback or input from others.
  - **Guarded:** Rarely asks for feedback and may appear self-contained.

- **Body language**
  - **Open:** Uses expressive body language, such as open posture, smiles, and gestures.
  - **Guarded:** Uses limited or neutral body language.

- **Focus of communication**
  - **Open:** Shows visible interest in personal connections and rapport.
  - **Guarded:** Prefers to focus on tasks and facts rather than personal topics.

- **Work-life separation**
  - **Open:** Blends personal and professional aspects, showing enthusiasm for personal engagement.
  - **Guarded:** Keeps professional and personal life distinctly separate.

- **Approachability**
  - **Open:** Approachable, empathetic, and encourages others to share their feelings.
  - **Guarded:** Appears cautious, deliberate, and less inviting to personal sharing.

### Adapted vs. natural

On page 19 you’ll find your personalized adapted and natural style graphs. On the left is the Adapted Style, and on the right is the Natural Style. The **Adapted Style** reflects the behaviors you perceive you should use in a specific context, like at work. Essentially, it represents how you adapt to meet the expectations of your role, whether that's with clients, colleagues, or within a professional environment. The **Natural Style,** on the other hand, shows your instinctive behaviors and motivations — your default mode of operation. Think of it as how you might act at home or in a setting where you feel entirely comfortable.

This course focuses on communication in a professional context, so the Adapted Style is the primary focus. However, it’s important to be aware of the Natural Style, as it often emerges in different situations, **especially under stress.** When the two styles align closely, it indicates that you tend to operate naturally in that environment. If there’s a significant difference, it may cause stress over time since you’re relying on behaviors that feel less comfortable or natural.

Below the graphs, there are four-digit segment numbers that correspond to specific adjectives in the Word Sketch pages. These adjectives describe tendencies in both Adapted and Natural Styles. The height of the points on the graphs indicates the intensity of these behaviors. Higher points represent a stronger impact on work and interactions, while lower points show less pronounced traits.

A key takeaway is that **self-awareness and adaptability are essential for effective communication.** Recognizing these patterns allows you to intentionally adjust behaviors to suit different situations. Permanent behavior changes require both awareness and practice, and the Behavior Adaptability Charts in the PDF are valuable tools to help develop this versatility.

It’s important to note that this is a **psychometric tool,** which is not designed to perfectly describe every aspect of personality. On average, these assessments are about **80% accurate,** providing a strong general sense of behaviors but not definitive details. For most people, around 80% of the assessment resonates. If something doesn’t seem to fit, it can be helpful to reflect on how others perceive your behavior. 

For example, you might encounter traits in the assessment that don’t align with how you see yourself. Seeking feedback from colleagues, friends, or family can provide insight into how others experience your behavior. Understanding these perceptions is a crucial step in improving self-awareness and fostering better connections with others.

### Word sketch

The word sketch on pages 17–18 focuses on the relationship between emotions, behaviors, and underlying motivators or needs. To recap from earlier: all emotions are valid — they aren’t inherently good or bad. However, the behaviors exhibited based on those emotions can be either productive or counterproductive. This chart, called a *Word Sketch*, connects behaviors, emotions, and needs to provide a framework for understanding what drives people’s actions.

Start by looking at the bottom row of the chart, which highlights observable behaviors — what others see and perceive. The purpose of this *Word Sketch* is to help interpret those behaviors and understand the motivations or needs behind them. Recognizing these patterns allows for better prediction of how someone prefers to communicate and respond in various situations, improving relationships and collaboration.

Take the “Supporter” column as an example. The observable behaviors for someone with high Supporter tendencies include being calming*, loyal, patient, peaceful, serene, and team-focused. What drives those behaviors? Looking at the associated needs and emotions, Supporters typically value stable environments, strong teams, and systems. Their primary emotion is patience or a stabilizing influence.

On the flip side, a Supporter’s fear is sudden change, instability, or loss of security. This connection is logical: someone who prioritizes stability will naturally fear losing it. From there, it makes sense to see behaviors like loyalty — staying committed to people or systems that provide stability — or calming and patient actions that contribute to a harmonious and predictable environment.

This same logic applies to the other behavior styles as well. The key takeaway is that **behaviors, emotions, and needs are interconnected.**

Psychometric assessments like this one are designed to provide insight into these patterns, though they are not perfect — they are meant to be about *80% accurate*. Still, they serve as a valuable tool for understanding both personal tendencies and those of others in various interactions.

## Understanding others

Now that we've explored understanding our own communication styles, let’s look at the differences between other communication styles.

Recognizing that others communicate differently helps you avoid misunderstandings. By considering their unique styles, you can interpret their behavior more accurately and anticipate their needs. This makes your collaboration more effective and helps you adapt to different work environments.

### Observing communication styles

This is about recognizing that we all have unique needs, motivations, and behaviors. *If we can understand the needs or motivators driving someone else’s behavior, we can adjust our communication to meet those needs more effectively.*

On **page 5 of the PDF**, there’s a chart that outlines the characteristics of the four basic communication styles. We’re not going to go through every detail, but you can use it as a reference. Here are some key traits to observe when identifying someone else’s style:

- **Pace:** Fast or slow talker?
- **Priority (task vs. people-oriented):** Focused on goals or relationships?

- **Tone of voice:** Formal, casual, encouraging, or direct?
- **Conflict resolution:** Avoid, confront, or mediate?
- **Decision-making:** Quick or deliberate?
- **Body language:** Do they gesture or stay reserved?
- **Formality:** Structured or relaxed in conversation?

*Understanding these cues allows you to adapt your communication style to align with theirs, which can lead to more productive and meaningful conversations.*

Let’s dive into some examples. For instance, **pace** can reveal a lot. Someone with a faster communication style might prefer to wrap up meetings with quick decisions and clear next steps. On the other hand, someone with a slower style might need time to process, preferring to revisit decisions later or discuss them over Slack. *Neither approach is better or worse—just different.*

**Priority** is another interesting area. Some people prioritize tasks and goals, focusing on the big picture or specific execution details. Others might prioritize relationships and participation, seeking collaboration or feedback. *Both approaches are valid and are sometimes more useful in certain situations than others.*

The chart also outlines **strengths and growth areas** for each style. For example, someone with “doer” tendencies might excel at leadership, administration, and innovation but may also be perceived as impatient or insensitive. *These aren’t flaws—they’re perceptions.* Being aware of how your style might come across to others helps you adjust accordingly.

Ultimately, *this is about recognizing that different communication styles lead to different perceptions.* By being mindful of those differences, we can adapt our approach to foster better understanding and collaboration.

### Cultural background and communication styles

[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimensions_theory) (6-D model) describes six dimensions of culture that help explain how people in different countries interact, work, and communicate. Understanding these dimensions can improve how we collaborate with both clients and teammates from diverse cultural backgrounds.

- **Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV):** Measures whether people prioritize personal goals (Individualism) or group goals (Collectivism).
  - **Individualistic cultures:** Emphasize personal achievement, autonomy, and individual rights. Examples: U.S. (highly individualistic), Canada, France, Israel.
  - **Collectivist cultures:** Value group harmony, loyalty, and interdependence. Examples: India, Brazil, Egypt.
  - **Comparison:** The U.S. scores high on individualism, meaning people value independence and personal responsibility, whereas countries like India or Brazil lean more towards group harmony and interdependence.
  - **Anecdote:** Received feedback from multiple Bitovians that U.S. folks tend to ask about the weather, whereas in their cultures they are used to talking about deeper topics like “work, sports, music, politics, and sometimes even religion.”
  - **Adaptation example:** A U.S. consultant working with a team in India might emphasize group benefits and team success over personal achievements to align with the collectivist mindset.

- **Power Distance Index (PDI):** Indicates how much less powerful members of a society accept unequal power distribution.
  - **Low power distance cultures:** Favor egalitarian workplaces, open communication, and questioning authority. Examples: U.S., Canada, Israel.
  - **High power distance cultures:** Value clear hierarchies, respect for authority, and less expectation of challenging leaders. Examples: India, Brazil, Egypt, France.
  - **Comparison:** The U.S. has a lower power distance, favoring flatter organizational structures compared to more hierarchical cultures like India or Egypt.
  - **Adaptation example:** When collaborating with a client in Brazil, a U.S. consultant might avoid directly challenging a senior team member's decision in public, opting instead to address concerns privately.

- **Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI):** Reflects how comfortable people are with ambiguity and uncertainty.
  - **Low uncertainty avoidance cultures:** Willingness to take risks, flexibility, and innovation. Examples: U.S., Canada, Israel.
  - **High uncertainty avoidance cultures:** Prefer rules, structure, and predictability. Examples: France, Brazil, Egypt, India.
  - **Comparison:** The U.S. is relatively low on uncertainty avoidance, valuing adaptability over rigid rules, unlike countries like France or Brazil, where people prefer more structure.
  - **Adaptation example:** While working with a client in France, a U.S. consultant might provide more detailed project plans and documentation to address their preference for structure and predictability.

- **Motivation Towards Achievement and Success (MAS):** Examines whether a culture prioritizes achievement and competition (Achievement) or care and quality of life (Success).
  - **Achievement cultures:** Focus on ambition, success, and material rewards. Examples: U.S., India, Brazil.
  - **Success cultures:** Emphasize cooperation, equality, and work-life balance. Examples: France, Canada, Israel, Egypt.
  - **Comparison:** The U.S. leans Achievement, favoring achievement and competition, while countries like Canada or France prioritize balance and collaboration.
  - **Adaptation example:** A U.S. consultant working with a Canadian team might focus on discussing work-life balance and the overall team’s well-being rather than emphasizing competition and individual accomplishments.

- **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Orientation (LTO):** Distinguishes between cultures that value long-term planning and perseverance (Long-Term) versus immediate results and traditions (Short-Term).
  - **Short-term oriented cultures:** Focus on the present, quick outcomes, and maintaining traditions. Examples: U.S., Canada, Brazil, Egypt.
  - **Long-term oriented cultures:** Emphasize future planning, thrift, and persistence. Examples: India, France, Israel.
  - **Comparison:** The U.S. is short-term oriented, favoring quick wins, while countries like India focus more on long-term strategies.
  - **Adaptation example:** When collaborating with a team in India, a U.S. consultant might frame discussions around long-term benefits and sustainability rather than focusing on quick wins.

- **Indulgence vs. Restraint (IVR):** Determines whether people allow themselves to enjoy life and indulge (Indulgence) or practice restraint due to strict societal norms.
  - **Indulgent cultures:** Encourage leisure, happiness, and personal freedom. Examples: U.S., Canada, Brazil, Israel.
  - **Restrained cultures:** Value discipline, duty, and control over desires. Examples: India, France, Egypt.
  - **Comparison:** The U.S. is indulgent, valuing freedom and enjoyment, while countries like Egypt or India lean towards restraint.
  - **Adaptation example:** A U.S. consultant working with a team in Egypt might moderate expressions of enthusiasm and avoid overly casual discussions to align with the more restrained cultural approach.

Understanding these cultural factors helps you tailor your communication style to fit the audience.

Tips and techniques:

- **Be aware of cultural norms:** Different cultures may have different norms regarding eye contact, personal space, or how direct to be in conversations. Take the time to learn about these differences when working with a diverse team.
- **Adjust your communication:** If you notice that a particular style — such as very direct communication — is causing discomfort, adapt accordingly. For example, some cultures value indirect communication, so it may be helpful to soften feedback in those contexts.
- **Recognize and celebrate differences:** Take time to acknowledge the different backgrounds and experiences within your team. Small gestures, like learning how to pronounce someone’s name correctly, show respect and inclusion. When in doubt, ask!
- **Language considerations:** Avoid jargon or idioms that might be confusing to those whose first language isn’t English. Use straightforward language to ensure everyone is on the same page.

## Adapting to others

Adapting your communication style makes your messages more effective and professional. By tailoring your approach to meet others’ preferences, you avoid missteps and strengthen connections. This flexibility helps teams work together more cohesively, improving outcomes for your projects.

To communicate effectively, adjust your style without changing your personality. For example:

- Provide context to a detail-oriented person.
- Keep it brief with someone who values conciseness.
- Send written communication to those who prefer it over face-to-face meetings.

Small adjustments help build stronger relationships with clients and colleagues.

Tips and techniques:

- **Be aware of neurodiversity:** Understand that communication preferences can vary between neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals. Adapt your style to meet different needs.

### Tension

- **Supporter vs. Doer:** Double Tensions of Patience vs. Urgency & People vs. Task
  - The Supporter’s slower pace and focus on people rather than results and tasks can conflict with the Doer’s sense of urgency to get results NOW.

- **Talker vs. Controller:** Double Tensions of Urgency vs. Patience & People vs. Task
  - The Talker’s higher urgency and focus on people can conflict with the Controller’s lack of urgency with a primary focus on tasks/results.

- **Supporter vs. Controller:** People vs. Tasks
  - The Supporter’s focus on other people, teamwork, and personal connection can conflict with the Controller’s focus on data, analysis, accuracy, and precision.

- **Talker vs. Doer:** People vs. Tasks
  - The Talker’s focus on other people, feelings, and political correctness can conflict with the Doer’s focus on results, tasks, and action.

- **Doer vs. Controller:** Urgency vs. Patience
  - The Doer’s focus on results and immediate action can conflict with the Controller’s focus on exercising patience to assure accuracy and avoid errors.

- **Talker vs. Supporter:** Urgency vs. Patience
  - The Talker’s sense of urgency and being direct can conflict with the Supporter’s innate patience and preference for being indirect.

### Understanding your audience

Your audience’s background, role, and level of technical expertise greatly influence how you should communicate with them. Understanding these differences is key to making sure your message is both clear and effective.

#### Communicating with technical vs. non-technical audiences

Technical audiences often seek detailed, data-driven information, while non-technical stakeholders usually need the broader context and implications of technical decisions.

For example, a technical stakeholder may want to know how a specific algorithm works, while a non-technical stakeholder, such as an executive, is more interested in understanding how the algorithm will impact business outcomes.

**Tailoring your communication style and presentations to match the technical level of your audience:** When presenting to technical stakeholders, use precise language, dive into technical details, and be prepared to answer in-depth questions. In contrast, when communicating with executives or other non-technical stakeholders, focus on the high-level impact, using visuals and simplified explanations to convey the message. For example, when explaining a new feature to a client’s CTO, you might discuss scalability and performance metrics. However, when explaining the same feature to a CEO, you might focus on how it will improve customer satisfaction or drive revenue.

**Strategies for simplifying technical jargon without losing meaning or accuracy:** To bridge the gap between technical and non-technical audiences, it’s important to distill complex concepts into simpler terms without oversimplifying. Use analogies, relatable examples, and clear definitions to explain technical terms.

For instance, instead of saying “low-latency,” you could say, “the system responds almost instantly, like when you click a link, and the page loads right away.” This keeps the essence of the technical detail while making it accessible.

Tips and techniques:

- **Start with context:** Before diving into details, give an overview of the problem or situation. This helps both technical and non-technical audiences understand the relevance of the information.
- **Use layered communication:** Begin with a high-level summary, then progressively dive into more detail. This approach allows your audience to stop you when they’ve received enough information.
- **Pause for questions:** Regularly check for understanding, especially with non-technical audiences. Ask open-ended questions like, “Does this make sense so far?” or “Would you like more detail on any part of this?”
- **Use visual aids:** Diagrams, flowcharts, and other visuals can help both technical and non-technical audiences grasp complex concepts more quickly.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you currently tailor your communication when speaking with technical versus non-technical stakeholders?
- Think of a recent interaction where you explained a technical concept. What worked well, and what could you have improved?
- Can you recall a time when a lack of understanding between technical and non-technical teams caused issues? How could communication have been improved in that situation?

#### Client vs. internal communication

Client communication often requires a higher level of formality and a focus on delivering value, while internal communication might be more collaborative and open. When dealing with clients, it’s important to maintain professionalism and align your messages with the client’s goals and expectations. Internally, the focus is on collaboration and keeping all team members aligned, which may involve more candid discussions and brainstorming sessions.

**Techniques for maintaining clarity, professionalism, and alignment with organizational goals in client communications:** Always start by understanding the client’s objectives and tailor your communication to show how your work supports these goals. Use clear, direct language, avoid unnecessary jargon, and make sure every interaction benefits the client relationship.

For example, when updating a client on project progress, provide clear status updates, highlight key achievements, and outline the next steps, keeping all communication aligned with the client’s strategic goals.

Provide enough background information so that team members from other disciplines can fully understand your perspective. Regular check-ins, using shared tools for tracking progress, and encouraging an open feedback culture are also essential. For example, a frontend developer should clearly explain how a design choice might affect the user experience or the ease of implementation, helping all team members collaborate effectively. -->

Tips and techniques:

- **Establish client expectations early:** During initial meetings, clarify the level of detail and formality your client expects. Adjust your communication style accordingly.
- **Be a proactive communicator:** For clients, send regular updates even if there’s nothing significant to report. This reassures them that you’re managing the project well. For internal teams, communicate frequently to maintain alignment.
- **Document key discussions:** Always follow up important client conversations with a summary email, capturing decisions made, next steps, and any action items. Internally, use shared tools to keep everyone in the loop.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you adjust your communication when switching from client interactions to internal team discussions?
- Think of a time when a project didn’t meet client expectations. How could better communication have changed the outcome?
- What strategies do you use to maintain clarity and alignment in both client and internal communications?

### Adapting to communication preferences and cultural norms

Adapting your communication style based on individual preferences and cultural differences is vital in a diverse workplace. Being flexible and mindful of these factors can greatly enhance your effectiveness in any professional setting.

#### Adjusting directness and openness in communication

Not everyone appreciates the same level of directness in communication. Some cultures or individuals might prefer a more indirect approach, while others value directness. Adjust your style by observing your audience’s reactions and feedback.

For example, in cultures where direct communication is valued, you might give straightforward feedback, saying, “This approach needs revision because it doesn’t meet the requirements.” In contrast, in a culture that favors indirectness, you might say, “This is a good start, but perhaps we could explore other options to align it more closely with the goals.”

#### Understanding the impact of cultural differences on communication and how to navigate them effectively

Cultural norms play a significant role in communication preferences.

For example, in some cultures, direct criticism is seen as constructive, while in others, it can be perceived as rude. Understanding these differences helps in avoiding misunderstandings and building stronger relationships.

Research the cultural backgrounds of your clients or team members, and be mindful of things like tone, body language, and even timing of communication. For instance, in some cultures, decisions are made quickly and decisively, while in others, there may be a more extended consultation process.

Tips and techniques:

- **Observe before acting:** In meetings, observe how others communicate before jumping in. This will give you insights into preferred communication styles, whether direct or indirect.
- **Use “I” statements:** When giving feedback or suggestions, especially in cultures that favor indirect communication, use “I” statements to soften the delivery. For example, “I noticed that…” rather than “You need to…”.
- **Mirror body language:** Subtly mirror your audience’s body language to build rapport. This can help create a more comfortable environment for open communication.
- **Ask for feedback on your communication style:** Regularly ask colleagues or clients from different cultures how they perceive your communication. This can help you make necessary adjustments.

Questions to reflect:

- How comfortable are you with direct versus indirect communication? When have you had to adjust your natural style?
- Think of a situation where cultural differences impacted communication. How did you navigate that, and what did you learn?
- What steps do you take to make sure your communication is culturally sensitive and appropriate?

#### Code-switching (matching language and tone to your audience)

Code-switching involves changing your language, tone, and even behavior to suit different social contexts. In a professional environment, this means adapting how you communicate depending on your audience — whether you’re talking to a peer, a superior, a client, or someone from a different cultural background. This skill is particularly important in consulting, where you might shift between highly technical discussions with developers and strategic conversations with executives.

**Practical strategies for adjusting language, tone, and formality depending on the audience and context:** To effectively code-switch, first assess your audience’s expectations and preferences. With peers or team members, you might use more informal language and a collaborative tone. When speaking with clients or senior executives, you should adopt a more formal tone, use polished language, and focus on high-level impacts.

For example, when discussing project timelines with a client, you might say, “We expect to deliver this feature by the end of Q3,” whereas with your internal team, you might say, “Let’s aim to wrap this up by the end of September.”

Tips and techniques:

- **Prepare phrases in advance:** For formal situations, have a set of professional phrases ready to use. This can help you smoothly switch to a more formal tone when needed.
- **Practice role-playing:** Role-play different scenarios with colleagues to practice adjusting your tone and language depending on the audience.
- **Use consistent key messages:** While your tone may change, the core message should remain consistent. Practice delivering the same message with different levels of formality and complexity.
- **Stay genuine:** Even when code-switching, keep your communication authentic. Forced formality or informality can come across as insincere.

Questions to reflect:

- In what situations do you find yourself needing to code-switch the most? How do you adapt your language and tone?
- Reflect on a time when you successfully adjusted your communication style for a specific audience. What was the outcome?
- How can you improve your ability to code-switch without losing the authenticity of your message?
