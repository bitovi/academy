@description Best practices for setting expectations to clients.

@body

## Setting Expectations

> Results - Expectations = Performance

The most basic consulting maxim is to exceed expectations. To say this another way, the best way to get your client to love you is to set low expectations and wildly exceed them. In reality, this means:

- Be careful to never over promise, especially when there are external dependencies or unknowns
- Pad estimates to account for external dependencies and unknowns

## The Consulting Trifecta

You may have heard the following maxim: cheap, fast, good… pick two. While this may be useful (and true) for sales discussions, a more useful variation for project planning is:

Scope, schedule, resources… pick two.

This means that any project lead or PM can “fix”:

- the scope and number of resources is fixed, the schedule must be variable
- the number of resources and schedule is fixed, the scope must be variable
- the scope and schedule is fixed, the number of resources must be variable

Think of a project as a balloon with three edges. If you squeeze two edges, the third must expand. If you squeeze all three edges, the balloon will pop.

Bad or inexperienced project managers will attempt to tell you that all three factors are already set, and we must “work harder” to meet expectations. This is a trap and we must push back immediately or we’ll be setting ourselves up for failure. No matter how small the project, there must be an opportunity at the start for the team to set at least one of these factors.

## Taking complete ownership of tasks and the overall project goals

Taking ownership means not only managing your specific responsibilities but also contributing to the broader success of the project. By embracing ownership, you can proactively solve problems, ensure effective communication, and drive the project toward its goals.

### Define and embrace ownership

Ownership means understanding your role within the project and how your work impacts the overall goals. It’s about taking initiative, being accountable, and committing to delivering real value.

- **Clarify roles and responsibilities:** Clearly define what you are expected to do. Understand the scope of your tasks and how these tasks align with the wider project goals. If you’re not sure, ask!
- **Set clear objectives:** Ensure you understand the project’s aims and your role in achieving them. Break down big goals into smaller, actionable steps to make progress measurable and manageable. For example, if the project goal is to launch a new feature, set objectives for design, development, testing, and deployment phases.

Tips and techniques:

- **Create a responsibility matrix:** Use a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) chart to map out roles and clarify who is responsible for each task.

Questions to reflect:

- Think of a recent project you worked on. How did you define your role and responsibilities? Were there any ambiguities?
- How do you ensure that your individual tasks contribute to the broader project goals?
- Describe a situation where taking ownership led to a successful outcome. What actions did you take?
- What challenges have you faced in embracing ownership, and how did you overcome them?

#### Exercise

**Ambiguous responsibility:** You are working on a project where roles are not clearly defined, leading to missed deadlines. How would you clarify responsibilities to your team and ensure alignment with the project goals?

### Foster effective communication

Effective communication is key to successful ownership. Regular updates and open information sharing keep the team aligned and accountable.

- **Hold regular updates:** Schedule daily or weekly meetings to review progress, tackle challenges, and plan next steps. These updates help keep the team on track. Use stand-ups, sprint reviews, and planning sessions to ensure everyone is informed and engaged.
- **Share information openly:** Use shared drives and project management tools like Jira to keep everyone informed. Regular emails and updates ensure transparency. For example, keep Jira tickets updated with the latest information and progress notes.
- **Encourage and act on feedback:** Implement frequent feedback sessions to discuss what’s working and what isn’t. Use this feedback to make necessary adjustments. Encourage an open-door policy where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and suggestions.

Tips and techniques:

- **Adopt the “one source of truth” principle:** Centralize all project documents in a single platform like Confluence.

Questions to reflect:

- How often do you communicate updates to your team? What methods do you use?
- What are the most common barriers to effective communication in a project setting?

### Proactively solve problems

Anticipating and addressing challenges before they escalate is crucial. Use your experience and your team’s expertise to develop and implement effective solutions.

- **Anticipate challenges:** Leverage your experience and insights to identify potential issues early. For example, if you foresee a delay in a deliverable due to a dependency, address it proactively.
- **Develop contingency plans:** Prepare alternative strategies to keep the project on track regardless of unexpected developments. Have backup plans for critical paths and high-risk areas.

Tips and techniques:

- **Conduct pre-mortem sessions:** Before starting a project phase, brainstorm potential challenges and their solutions to anticipate issues.

Questions to reflect:

- Describe a situation where you anticipated a challenge before it became a major issue. How did you address it?

#### Exercise

**Unexpected roadblocks:** Midway through a project, a key team member falls ill, causing potential delays. How would you adjust the project plan and leverage team expertise to stay on track?

### Use effective project management tools and techniques

Choosing and using the right tools and techniques to manage your project efficiently and effectively can make a significant difference in its success.

- **Keep project management software updated:** Ensure tools like Jira are always up to date to reflect current progress. This helps in tracking tasks and identifying bottlenecks early.
- **Manage your time efficiently:** Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique or time-blocking to stay focused and productive. These methods help in managing your workload and reducing distractions.

Tips and techniques:

- **Customize dashboards:** Personalize project management dashboards to highlight key metrics and deadlines, making it easier to track progress at a glance.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you ensure that your project management software is always up to date?

#### Exercise

**Outdated information:** Your project management software has outdated information, causing confusion. How would you ensure regular updates and accurate data?

**Time blocking:** You have multiple deadlines approaching. How would you use time-blocking to manage your tasks efficiently and meet all deadlines?

### Reflect and improve continuously

Regular reflection and feedback are essential for continuous improvement and project success.

- **Review milestones:** Regularly check progress at key points to ensure the project is on track and make necessary adjustments. Milestone reviews help in reassessing project direction and priorities.
- **Conduct retrospectives:** After completing project phases or the entire project, gather insights on what went well and areas for improvement. Use this feedback to refine processes and practices.
- **Implement feedback:** Use feedback from retrospectives to continuously improve. Document lessons learned and apply them to future projects.

Tips and techniques:

- **Use “5 Whys” analysis:** For every problem identified during retrospectives, ask “why” five times to get to the root cause.

Questions to reflect:

- How often do you review project milestones, and what criteria do you use?

#### Exercise

**Mid-project review:** Halfway through a project, you realize that certain goals are not being met. How would you conduct a milestone review and adjust the plan accordingly?

### Connect individual efforts to business outcomes

Helping your team understand how their daily work contributes to broader business goals reinforces the importance of their contributions.

- **Link daily tasks to strategic goals:** Show how everyday tasks contribute to the company’s success, helping team members see the bigger picture. For example, explain how improving a user interface can lead to better user retention and increased revenue.
- **Measure impact:** Use metrics and KPIs to demonstrate how individual efforts lead to project and overall business achievements. Share these metrics with the team to highlight their contributions.

By embracing ownership, fostering effective communication, solving problems proactively, utilizing project management tools, empowering your team, reflecting continuously, and connecting individual efforts to business outcomes, you can drive your consulting projects to success.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you communicate the impact of daily tasks on broader business goals to your team?
- Describe a time when linking daily tasks to strategic goals motivated your team.

#### Exercise

**Disconnected tasks:** Your team feels that their daily tasks are not contributing to the overall project goals. How would you reconnect their efforts to the bigger picture?

**Measuring success:** Your client wants to understand the impact of your team’s work on their business goals. How would you demonstrate this using metrics and KPIs?

## Balancing progress and oversight

There will always be a tradeoff between moving a project forward and getting sign-off from a client or stakeholder. You may often deal with clients who say they want to be involved in many layers of decisions but they are so busy or non-responsive that progress becomes blocked waiting for their approvals.

We’ve found the best practice for balancing these concerns is to optimize for progress, but give stakeholders plenty of opportunities to weigh in or course correct. In other words, in most cases, move forward with your best judgement, but visibly document your course via emails or tickets, in a way where clients can step in if they desire.

### Keep stakeholders informed

During the normal course of your work, be sure to:

- **Keep project management tools up to date:** Tools like Jira can provide a single source of truth for the project’s progress. Always keep it up to date and add comments to issues if it’s in progress for more than a day.
- **Summarize project status in weekly updates:** This can be in the form of a Slack post or email, depending on the audience. Weekly updates provide a regular way for you to report progress and flag when a blocker needs to be addressed.
- **Use sprint demos/reviews to show progress:** Ideally, all stakeholders will attend sprint demos to learn more about work that’s being implemented. Even if they don’t attend the meeting, it can be recorded and sent to them as a reference.
- **Use backlog grooming to identify risks:** When refining issues in a backlog, point out the items that are unclear, need answers, or will need stakeholder input before they are worked on. The earlier those things can be addressed, the less risky the work will be when it’s picked up.

Tips and techniques:

- **Add a Blocked column:** In tools like Jira, adding a “Blocked” column to the far left of the sprint board can make it very clear when there are blockers that need to be handled.
- **Implement weekly updates (even if you don’t think they’re required):** It is always useful to summarize progress to stakeholders to build trust. If things start to go off track, it’s easier to put that at the top of a weekly status update (vs. having to communicate bad news in the first update).
- **Develop a communication plan:** Create a detailed communication plan that outlines what information will be shared, when, how, and with whom. This plan should address the needs of all stakeholders and ensure transparency throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Tailor communication styles:** Adapt your communication style to suit the preferences of different stakeholders. For example, some stakeholders might prefer detailed reports, while others might prefer concise summaries or visual presentations.
- **Templates and formats:** Use standardized templates for reports and updates to maintain consistency and clarity in communication.
- **Weekly summary emails:** Send out weekly summary emails highlighting key achievements, upcoming tasks, and any issues needing attention.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you balance involving stakeholders in decision-making without slowing down project progress?
- Describe a time when stakeholder feedback led to a significant change in a project. How did you handle the change?
- What strategies do you use to encourage stakeholder participation in review sessions?
- Think about a project where communication broke down. What were the consequences, and how could they have been avoided?

### Identify when a stakeholder is required for a decision

Stakeholders don’t typically need to be involved in:

- Minor addjustments: Small tweaks that don’t significantly affect the project.
- Operational details: Day-to-day operational decisions that don’t impact the project’s core objectives.
- Technical details: Technical choices that don’t have a greater business impact.

The almost always need to be involved in:

- **Scope adjustments:** Alters the project scope or objectives.
- **Timeline changes:** Affects the project deadlines or delivery dates.
- **Strategic direction:** Influences the overall strategic direction of the project.
- **Critical requirements:** Impacts core functionalities or key deliverables.

Before escalating your communication, consider:

- **Who** it’s important to: Involve the stakeholders who have a vested interest in getting the problem solved.
- **What** needs to be decided: Focus on the most important things that need to be resolved first.
- **When** you need a decision by: Communicate this and share the impact of not having a decision by a specific date.
- **Why** the decision needs to be made: If you move forward with what you think is best, will there be any ramifications later?

### Escalate blockers to stakeholders

If the matter at hand is an actual blocker, try to get a hold of the stakeholder:

1) **Message them directly:** Include a short summary of what you need a decision on with a link to more information.
2) **Schedule a meeting:** Look at their calendar and find their first available slot. When possible, include a link to a message in your chat tool or a comment in the project management tool that explains the blocker so they can read up on it before the meeting.
3) **Call them directly:** Tools such as Microsoft Teams or Slack allow you to call another person. Avoid calling them if you know they’re in another meeting.
4) **Tell your lead/manager/etc.:** Let someone else know that you’re blocked and ask them for advice for escalating it more.

In any case, try to explain what you will do if you do not hear back from them, or make it clear you are completely blocked on a piece of work until you’ve had a chance to discuss it with them.

### Exercise

#### The unresponsive client

You’re in charge of adding a search box to a component. You could build it into the existing grid in a completely abstract way, which would take 5 days, or you could make it work in the way needed for this specific use case, which would take two days. You ask your client which they would prefer but they are in two days of meetings and not replying promptly. This is the most important feature right now, so switching to something else isn’t a viable option.

**What do you do?**

<details>
<summary>
Answer
</summary>

How likely is it that the project will reuse the search feature in a future grid? For example, assume, based on your current knowledge, there’s a less than 25% chance of reuse. Therefore, I would recommend choosing the non-abstract approach, and writing an email, or writing a comment on the ticket tagging your client which summarizes your decision, the reasons for it, and states “I will proceed with this approach, but let me know if you disagree”. Forward progress is being made, but with transparency and giving your client the opportunity to course correct if they have different information.

Principals used:

- Balancing progress and oversight

## Advocating for tool and process change to improve efficiency

In consulting, advocating for tool and process changes can significantly enhance project efficiency and client satisfaction. This section aims to equip you with the skills to identify, propose, and implement changes that can lead to better performance and streamlined operations.

### Understanding current tools and processes

Before recommending changes, it’s crucial to understand the existing tools and processes thoroughly.

- **Examine existing tools and processes:** Conduct a thorough review of the current tools and processes used. Investigate their functionalities, limitations, and areas of strength. Evaluate how they contribute to project goals and where they fall short.
- **Gather user insights:** Engage with daily users through interviews or surveys to collect their feedback on the tools and processes. Identify pain points and areas for improvement. User insights are invaluable as they reflect real-world experiences and challenges.
- **Map current workflows:** Create detailed workflow diagrams to visualize the existing processes. Identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas prone to errors. This visual representation helps in understanding the flow and pinpointing issues.
- **Analyze performance data:** Examine performance metrics such as speed, error rates, and user satisfaction levels to gain a quantitative understanding of the tools’ effectiveness. Data-driven insights provide a solid foundation for proposing changes.

Tips and techniques:

- **Create a checklist:** Develop a detailed checklist of features, pros, cons, and usage scenarios for each tool to streamline the evaluation process.
- **Use software tools:** Use workflow mapping software like Lucidchart or Miro to create dynamic and interactive diagrams.

### Analyzing gaps

Conducting a gap analysis helps identify areas for improvement by comparing current practices with industry best practices.

- **Compare with best practices:** Think through how the current tools and processes measure up against industry best practices. Highlight areas where improvements are needed. This step provides a clear direction for enhancements.
- **Spot inefficiencies:** Identify specific inefficiencies or redundancies in the current workflows. Look for processes that are outdated, overly complex, or unnecessary.
- **Prioritize gaps:** Evaluate the impact of identified gaps on project performance and prioritize them based on urgency and potential benefits. Focus on the most critical areas first for maximum impact.

Tips and techniques:

- **Error log analysis:** Regularly review error logs to identify recurring issues and their root causes.
- **Impact-effort matrix:** Use an impact-effort matrix to prioritize gaps based on their potential benefits and the effort required to address them.
- **Stakeholder input:** Gather input from key stakeholders to understand the most pressing issues and their impact on overall goals.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you prioritize gaps when multiple areas need improvement? What criteria do you use to evaluate their urgency and potential benefits?

### Identifying solutions

With a clear understanding of gaps and inefficiencies, the next step is to identify potential solutions.

- **Propose new tools and process tweaks:** Brainstorm potential solutions, including new tools or adjustments to existing processes, to address the identified gaps. Consider cost, ease of implementation, and expected benefits.
- **Plan integration strategies:** Develop strategies for integrating new solutions with existing systems, ensuring minimal disruption. Plan for any necessary data migration, compatibility checks, and integration testing.

Tips and techniques:

- **Phased approach:** Design a phased integration plan that allows gradual implementation and adjustment.
- **Feedback loops:** Establish continuous feedback loops with end-users to gather insights on usability.

### Engaging stakeholders

Engaging stakeholders is critical for gaining support and ensuring successful implementation of proposed changes.

- **Present findings and proposals:** Develop clear, data-backed presentations to communicate findings and proposed changes to stakeholders. Use visuals and real-world examples to make your case compelling.
- **Conduct workshops and demos:** Organize workshops or demonstration sessions to show the benefits of proposed changes. Interactive sessions help stakeholders experience the potential improvements firsthand.
- **Address concerns:** Prepare to address stakeholder concerns and answer questions to build support and consensus. Be transparent about potential challenges and your plans to mitigate them.

Tips and techniques:

- **Visualization:** Use infographics and visual aids to clearly illustrate key points and findings.
- **FAQ sessions:** Prepare a comprehensive FAQ document to address common concerns and questions.
- **One-on-one meetings:** Schedule one-on-one meetings with key stakeholders to address their specific concerns and gather their support.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you prepare for presenting findings and proposals to stakeholders? What key points do you focus on?
- What strategies do you use to address stakeholder concerns and build support for proposed changes?

### Running a pilot test

Testing proposed changes on a small scale helps validate their effectiveness before full-scale implementation.

- **Initiate a small-scale trial:** Implement the proposed changes on a small scale to test their effectiveness. Choose a pilot group that represents the broader user base.
- **Define pilot goals:** Establish specific, measurable goals for the pilot, such as improved efficiency, reduced errors, or higher user satisfaction. Clear goals help in evaluating success.

Tips and techniques:

- **Success criteria:** Establish clear success criteria to evaluate the pilot’s outcomes.

### Analyzing the outcomes

After the pilot, it’s important to analyze the outcomes and refine the implementation plan based on feedback.

- **Evaluate pilot outcomes:** Analyze the results of the pilot against the established goals to determine its success. Look for improvements in key metrics and overall user experience.
- **Revise implementation plan:** Adjust the implementation plan based on the pilot outcomes to ensure optimal results during full-scale rollout. Incorporate lessons learned to avoid potential pitfalls.

Tips and techniques:

- **Performance metrics:** Compare pilot outcomes against predefined metrics to objectively assess success.
- **Iterative adjustments:** Make iterative adjustments to the implementation plan based on feedback to refine the process.
- **Stakeholder review:** Share revised plans with stakeholders for final review and approval before full-scale rollout.

### Rolling out the full-scale implementation

Successful pilot testing paves the way for full-scale implementation, which requires careful planning and execution.

- **Develop a detailed rollout plan:** Create a comprehensive plan for the full-scale implementation of successful changes. Include timelines, responsibilities, and key milestones.
- **Prepare training and support resources:** Develop training materials and support resources to help users transition smoothly to the new tools and processes. Provide ongoing support to address any issues.
- **Implement in stages:** Roll out the changes in phases to manage risk and allow for incremental adjustments. This approach minimizes disruption and allows for continuous improvement.

Tips and techniques:

- **Timeline:** Create a detailed timeline with key milestones and deliverables for the rollout.
- **Phased rollout:** Implement changes in manageable phases to allow for adjustments and minimize disruptions.

Questions to reflect:

- How will you ensure that the rollout plan is detailed and comprehensive?

### Continuously improving over time

Continuous improvement ensures that the new tools and processes remain effective and relevant over time.

- **Establish a monitoring system:** Set up mechanisms to continuously track the performance of new tools and processes. Regular monitoring helps in identifying issues early and making timely adjustments.

Tips and techniques:

- **Performance dashboards:** Set up performance dashboards to continuously monitor key metrics and identify areas for improvement.

### Documentation and standardization

Proper documentation and standardization are crucial for consistency and alignment within the team.

- **Document new processes:** Create comprehensive documentation for the new tools and processes, including usage guidelines and best practices. Ensure that documentation is accessible and easy to understand.
- **Update training materials:** Revise training materials to reflect the new methods and ensure they are easily accessible to all team members. Regularly update materials to keep them current.
- **Ensure team alignment:** Standardize the changes across projects to ensure consistency and alignment within the team. Consistent practices lead to more predictable and reliable outcomes.

Tips and techniques:

- **Step-by-step guides:** Create detailed, step-by-step guides for each new process to ensure clarity and consistency.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you ensure comprehensive documentation for new tools and processes?
- What strategies do you use to standardize changes across projects and ensure team alignment?

## Pushing back

Inexperienced consultants tend to be pushovers and think of project constraints as fixed and unchangeable.

Experienced consultants recognize that nothing in a project is truly unchangeable. The key to their success is identifying the largest problems standing in the way of the project success and pushing back on them, as hard as necessary.

### Identifying unreasonable expectations

Understanding and identifying unreasonable expectations is the first step in managing client demands.

- **Defining unreasonable expectations:** Unreasonable expectations often stem from insufficient resources, technological limitations, or clients demanding more work than is feasible within a given timeframe. For example, a client may request a complete overhaul of their system within a month, which would typically require several months of dedicated effort.
- **Recognizing the signs:** Compare the client’s requests with past project experiences and your current team’s capabilities. If a request significantly exceeds these, it likely falls into the unreasonable category. For instance, expecting a feature-rich application from a two-person team in a few weeks when it usually takes a larger team several months is a clear sign.

Tips and techniques:

- **Create a checklist:** Develop a checklist of factors that typically indicate unrealistic expectations, such as tight deadlines, budget constraints, and resource limitations.
- **Scenario analysis:** Run “what-if” scenarios to see the impact of client demands on project timelines and resources.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you differentiate between a challenging request and an unreasonable one? What criteria do you use?

### Effective communication techniques

Clear and effective communication is essential to address and manage client expectations appropriately.

- **Be transparent and direct:** Always convey what your team can realistically achieve. Avoid overpromising to please the client initially. For example, if a client asks for a complex feature that requires six months, explain why it’s not possible to deliver it in three.
- **Support with evidence:** Use data and past project experiences to justify your stance. For instance, create estimates for the individual pieces of work to show how they exceed the expected timeline.
- **Practice active listening:** Understand the client’s underlying needs by listening empathetically. This helps in addressing their core requirements even if their initial requests are unrealistic. For instance, a client asking for a rapid deployment might be worried about market competition, which you can address by proposing a phased release.

Tips and techniques:

- **Summarize and validate:** Summarize what the client said and validate their concerns before presenting your counterpoints.
- **Use “I” statements:** Frame your responses with “I” statements to express concerns without sounding accusatory (e.g., “I feel that this timeline might not be achievable because…”).

Questions to reflect:

- How do you ensure clarity when explaining to a client why their request cannot be met?
- What strategies do you use to gather and present evidence that supports your position?

### Strategic negotiation tactics

Negotiation is key to aligning client expectations with project realities.

- **Set firm boundaries:** Clearly define what is achievable with the current resources. State these boundaries upfront to avoid misunderstandings later. For example, “Our team can deliver this module by the end of Q2, but not the entire project.”
- **Propose viable alternatives:** Offer realistic options that align with the client’s objectives. If a client wants a complex feature quickly, suggest developing a simpler MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first.
- **Break the project into phases:** Phased-base agreements allow for periodic reassessment and adjustment of expectations. This can also help in delivering incremental value to the client, making the progress tangible.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you establish boundaries without damaging the client relationship?
- Can you recall a time when proposing alternatives led to a successful negotiation? What alternatives did you offer?
- What are the benefits of using phase-based agreements in managing client expectations?

### Robust project management practices

Strong project management practices are essential for maintaining realistic expectations and delivering on commitments.

- **Maintain scope integrity:** Regularly review the project scope to ensure alignment with the agreed terms. For example, use scope documents and change request logs to manage additions or modifications.
- **Proactive risk management:** Identify potential risks from the onset and develop mitigation strategies. For instance, if a particular technology is new to the team, allocate extra time for training and potential troubleshooting.

Tips and techniques:

- **Weekly check-ins:** Schedule regular check-ins to monitor scope and resource allocation, ensuring alignment with the project plan.
- **Task prioritization:** Use tools like the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.
- **Contingency planning:** Develop contingency plans for critical project risks and ensure the team knows how to implement them.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you ensure the project scope remains aligned with client agreements?

### Influencing and persuasion skills

Being able to influence and persuade clients is vital for successful expectation management.

- **Guide the conversation:** Frame your feedback in a way that emphasizes achieving the best possible project outcome. For instance, “To ensure we deliver a robust and high-quality product, we recommend extending the timeline by two weeks.”
- **Build and leverage credibility:** Use your experience and past project successes to support your perspectives on feasibility. Highlighting your expertise can build trust and make clients more receptive to your recommendations.
- **Foster consensus:** Use regular meetings or workshops to align all stakeholders and achieve mutual understanding. Consensus helps in ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding project scope and timelines.

Tips and techniques:

- **Storytelling:** Use storytelling to make your points more relatable and compelling, sharing relevant past successes and challenges.
- **Ethos, Pathos, Logos:** Structure your arguments around credibility (ethos), emotional appeal (pathos), and logical reasoning (logos).

Questions to reflect:

- In what ways can guiding the conversation help achieve better project outcomes?
- How do you foster consensus among stakeholders with differing priorities?

### Documenting agreements and changes

Proper documentation is essential for managing and communicating expectations clearly.

- **Maintain change logs:** Record any changes in project scope or expectations. This ensures that everyone is aware of what has been agreed upon.
- **Regular updates:** Provide frequent updates to keep everyone informed about progress and any changes in expectations. This can be done through weekly status reports or regular client meetings.

Tips and techniques:

- **Meeting minutes:** Keep detailed meeting minutes and distribute them to all stakeholders to ensure everyone is on the same page.
- **Change request forms:** Implement formal change request forms to document any changes in project scope or expectations.

Questions to reflect:

- How do you ensure all changes in project scope are accurately documented?

### Exercise

#### Project planning

Your client informs you that your team will be working on a new feature for your project. They’ve committed to an internal deadline of July 1st, with a non-negotiable set of requirements, and you have a team of yourself and 2 devs to deliver.

**What do you do?**

<details>
<summary>
Answer
</summary>

Let them know that plan is likely untenable, and that you’d like to evaluate the scope before committing to that deadline (otherwise there’s risk in not meeting it). Work with them to find a scope that keeps them within their time and staffing constraints. If they are not flexible, explain the scope-resources-deadline trifecta and the risks. Ask them to consider additional resources, or a more flexible deadline.

Principals used:

- The Consulting Trifecta
- Pushing Back

</details>

#### The difficult developer

There is one particularly grumpy client developer that joins your team in the middle of the project. Every idea you propose they argue against. They tend to nitpick all your pull requests with [bikeshed-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) comments. Recently, they proposed that we rewrite our project in Angular because it’s easier to onboard new developers to a popular framework.

**What do you do?**

<details>
<summary>
Answer
</summary>

Reach out to the developer and try to get to know them better. Try to understand their concerns and be flexible when necessary. Do your best to communicate your position and find a way to work together. Remind the developer that you share the same goals, and that finding common ground will benefit everyone on the team.

Bring up your concerns during a team retrospective and try to develop consensus on the best approach. If all of that fails, work with the team lead and the client to mediate and identify the best possible outcome.

Principles used:

- Remember that you share common goals
- Building rapport
- Pushing back

</details>

## Speaking truth to power in an effective way

Speaking truth to power means being honest and transparent with those in authority, even when the truth may be uncomfortable or unwelcome. This concept is vital for maintaining integrity and fostering a culture of accountability within any organization. For consultants, this means providing clients with honest feedback and insights, regardless of the potential for conflict or discomfort.

- **What it means:** Being open and honest with the people in charge, even if it might stir up some trouble.
- **Why it matters:** It helps maintain honesty and responsibility in decision-making, creating an environment where truth matters more than rank.
- **Possible hurdles:** Worrying about negative outcomes, damaging relationships, or being left out of future opportunities.

### Preparing your message

Before delivering difficult truths, it is essential to prepare thoroughly to ensure your message is well-received and impactful.

- **Check your facts:** Make sure everything you say can be supported with data and evidence. This means doing your homework, double-checking your information, and thinking about potential challenges to your points. Providing a strong factual basis builds credibility and minimizes the risk of disputes over the accuracy of your statements.
- **Understand stakeholder perspectives:** Think through what each party stands to gain or lose and tailor your message to address these concerns effectively. Understanding different viewpoints helps in framing your message in a way that resonates with all stakeholders.
- **Plan your approach:** Lay out your main points clearly and decide the best way to explain them convincingly. Structuring your argument logically makes it easier for others to follow and understand.
- **Anticipate responses:** Think about the possible pushback and emotional responses you might get, and prepare thoughtful, calm replies. Being prepared for objections allows you to address concerns confidently and maintain control of the conversation.
- **Cultural considerations:** Address how different organizational cultures might impact the approach to speaking truth to power and adapt strategies accordingly. Some cultures value directness while others may prefer a more nuanced approach.
- **Develop emotional intelligence:** Enhance your ability to understand and manage emotional responses, both your own and those of others. High emotional intelligence helps in navigating sensitive conversations and maintaining a positive tone.

Tips and techniques:

- **Data visualization:** Use charts, graphs, and infographics to present your data compellingly and clearly.
- **Stakeholder mapping:** Create a visual map of stakeholders, their interests, and their influence to tailor your message appropriately.
- **Role reversal:** Put yourself in the shoes of your stakeholders to better understand their perspectives and concerns.

### Developing emotional intelligence

Emotional intelligence is a critical skill for consultants, allowing you to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics and foster positive client relationships. Developing your emotional intelligence involves several key components:

- **Self-awareness:** Learn to recognize your own emotions and understand how they affect your thoughts and behavior. This self-awareness allows you to stay in control during high-stakes interactions and reflect on how your emotions influence your decision-making and communication style.
- **Self-regulation:** Practice techniques to manage your emotions healthily and productively. This could involve deep-breathing exercises, mindfulness practices, or taking a moment to pause before responding. Effective self-regulation helps you maintain professionalism and poise, even in challenging situations.
- **Motivation:** Identify your intrinsic motivators and set personal goals aligned with them. Understanding what drives you can enhance your focus and resilience, ensuring you remain committed and enthusiastic about your work.
- **Empathy:** Improve active listening and understanding of others’ perspectives. Empathy allows you to connect with clients and other Bitovians on a deeper level, fostering trust and cooperation. Practice empathy by listening without interrupting and validating others’ feelings.
- **Social skills:** Build rapport, enhance communication, and develop conflict resolution strategies. Strong social skills enable you to navigate complex social landscapes, mediate disputes effectively, and build lasting, positive relationships with clients and team members.

Tips and techniques:

- **Emotional labeling:** Practice identifying and labeling emotions in yourself and others during interactions to improve emotional recognition.
- **Breathing techniques:** Use techniques like the 4-7-8 breathing method to stay composed and manage stress.

### Delivering your message effectively

When it’s time to convey your message, the manner of delivery can be just as important as the content itself.

- **Pick the right moment:** Choose a setting that’s private and free from interruptions, e.g. a 1:1 chat. This ensures the conversation can proceed without distractions and allows for a candid exchange.
- **Use clear, professional language:** Communicate in a straightforward and respectful manner, avoiding jargon unless everyone understands it. Clarity helps prevent misunderstandings and keeps the focus on the message.
- **Start on a positive note:** Lead with what’s going well or the strengths of the project or plan, setting a positive tone for the conversation. This can help soften the impact of more critical feedback.
- **Be direct yet courteous:** Convey your points clearly while maintaining politeness and professionalism. Being direct avoids ambiguity, but courtesy ensures the message is not perceived as hostile.
- **Use the “data sandwich” method:** Begin with data to present the problem, explain what it means, and finish with more data to back up your conclusion. This method reinforces your points with evidence, making them harder to dismiss.
- **Encourage discussion:** Ask questions to start a dialogue and show you’re willing to consider other points of view. Engaging in a two-way conversation demonstrates respect and openness.
- **Show your commitment:** Remind everyone of your commitment to the project’s success and your supportive role as a consultant. Emphasizing your shared goals can foster a collaborative spirit.

Tips and techniques:

- **Language refinement:** Use apps or tools to refine your language, ensuring it’s clear, professional, and free of unnecessary jargon.
- **Clarity drills:** Practice delivering your main points in one to two sentences to ensure clarity and conciseness.

### Following up on your message

The conversation doesn’t end when you’ve delivered your message. Effective follow-up ensures your feedback leads to positive change.

- **Keep the conversation going:** Provide more information or data if needed and help with any issues that come up. Continuous support shows your investment in the project’s success.
- **Document key points:** Record the main points and agreed-upon actions to ensure progress is tracked. Documentation helps maintain clarity and accountability.
- **Review the impact:** Think about how your message was received and the discussion that followed to improve your technique next time. Reflecting on the outcomes allows for personal growth and better future interactions.
- **Manage long-term relationships:** Develop strategies for maintaining positive long-term relationships with clients and stakeholders after delivering difficult messages. Building trust and rapport is essential for ongoing collaboration and success.

Tips and techniques:

- **Follow-up schedule:** Establish a follow-up schedule with specific dates and times to discuss progress and next steps.
- **Summarization emails:** Send a concise summary email after your meeting, highlighting key points and agreed-upon actions.

### Creating a feedback-friendly culture

Creating a feedback-friendly culture is essential for continuous improvement and fostering an environment of trust and open communication. Here’s how to cultivate this culture:

- **Lead by example:** Show how open you are to feedback in your own work, proving it’s a crucial part of improving. Share examples of how feedback has positively impacted your performance and decision-making. This demonstrates that feedback is a valuable tool rather than a threat.
- **Set the tone early:** Make it clear from the beginning that honest, constructive communication is valued in your consulting work. Establish norms and expectations around feedback in initial meetings and reiterate its importance throughout the project. Encourage an atmosphere where team members feel safe to express their ideas and concerns.
- **Consider cultural differences:** Recognize that different cultures have varying norms around hierarchy and directness. For instance, in cultures that value indirect communication, feedback might be framed more diplomatically, while in more direct cultures, straightforwardness can be appreciated. Being culturally sensitive in your approach ensures that feedback is received positively and constructively.

Tips and techniques:

- **Feedback rituals:** Establish regular rituals, such as end-of-project reviews, where feedback is a standard part of the process.
- **Anonymous feedback options:** Provide anonymous feedback tools to encourage honest input from team members who may feel uncomfortable speaking up directly.

### Exercise

Questions to reflect:

- Have you ever had to deliver difficult news or feedback to a senior leader? What was the outcome, and what did you learn from the experience?
- Think about a time when you hesitated to speak up about an issue. What were your concerns, and how might you handle a similar situation differently now?
- Imagine you’re consulting on a project where you discover a significant flaw in the proposed strategy. What steps would you take to address this with the leadership team?
- How would you approach a situation where a stakeholder is emotionally attached to a failing project component, and you need to persuade them to consider alternatives?
- How do you balance the need for honesty with maintaining a positive relationship with a client?
- How would you adjust your approach to speaking truth to power in an organization with a very hierarchical culture?

#### Scenario 1: Misaligned expectations

You discover that the project expectations set by the senior leadership are unrealistic given the current resources and timeline.

**How would you present this issue to the leadership without causing alarm or defensiveness? What data and strategies would you use to support your message?**
