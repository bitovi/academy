the delivery team.

@body

## Overview

For most projects, the people who will sell the work are not the same people
who perform the work. A successful transition from the sales team to the delivery team
is _critically_ important to ensuring project success. This guide walks through
how to have an effective and efficient transition process leaves no surprises for the future.

## Goals

The goals of a good transition:

- Clearly documenting and communicating expectations with the client and delivery teams.
- Eliminating as many "unknown unknowns" as possible.
- The client is not wasting time repeating themselves.

## Problems

- Sales teams are the first group of people to interact with a client. They get
  a lot of knowledge of the project, the client, process, etc. This information
  needs to be provided to the delivery team.
- Clients often don't have agreed upon goals and processes themselves.
- Sales teams want to sell and transition to delivery. They must do
  due diligence.


## Solutions


## Take notes that you can share

To facilitate efficient communication in the future, it's important
to create organized documents that can be shared with:

- a future delivery team (so they don't have to ask clients the
  same questions in the future)
- the client (so they can confirm our interpretation of their information)

Begin the process right away by creating a copy of the [App Summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ0LyoeWCDYaMsYUQARQ-QyqUPpReVDPUIqQ56uy9S3Hw52v2DBl_PRHgwSEtt4UYVjykT3wxWX8Znw/pub) document:

> __PRO TIP__: Fill out this document with the client. Share

> them is a great way to pace a conversation and ensure
> you are collecting information correctly.

## Set clear expectations on culture and work/life balance

We have a [Bitovi Policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSUcxXideVUG8AgA-Zsmx9sA2knaawPyDENds4orhD98xrFBoexDwHo0yCiYYdTcJ5dOqpM51_qg9gV/pub) document that outlines our policies like PTO and general workplace expectations. This can be shared with the client or the important parts clearly communicated.


## Get a signed statement of work

TODO: Example SOW.

- make sure people know how to report work
