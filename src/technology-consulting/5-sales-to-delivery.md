@description Learn how to successfully transition a project from the sales team to
the delivery team.

@body

## Overview

For most projects, the people who will sell the work are not the same people
who perform the work. A successful transition from the sales team to the delivery team
is _critically_ important to ensuring project success. This guide walks through
how to have an effective and efficient transition process leaves no surprises for the future.

## Goals

The goals of a good transition:

- Clearly documenting and communicating expectations with the client and delivery teams.
- Eliminating as many "unknown unknowns" as possible.
- The client is not wasting time repeating themselves to the sales team and then to
  the delivery team.

## Problems

- Sales teams are the first group of people to interact with a client. They get
a lot of knowledge of the project, the client, process, etc. This information
needs to be provided to the delivery team.
- Clients often don't have agreed upon goals and processes themselves.
- Sales teams want to sell and transition to delivery. They must do
due diligence.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create and fill out the [App Summary document](#appsummarydocument)
- [ ] Share the App Summary and [Consultancy Policies](#consultancypoliciesdocument) documents with the client
- [ ] Share the App Summary document with the delivery team
- [ ] Create a SOW
- [ ] Review the SOW with the delivery team
- [ ] Get a signed SOW by the client
- [ ] Share the SOW with Accounts Receivable
  - [ ] Time tracking is setup
  - [ ] Billing processes are in place
- [ ] Hold an [internal kickoff meeting](#internalkickoffmeeting).  
- [ ] Hold an [external kickoff meeting](#clientkickoffmeeting).

## App Summary document

To facilitate efficient communication in the future, it's important
to create organized documents _now_ that can be shared with:

- a future delivery team (so they don't have to ask clients the
  same questions in the future)
- the client (so they can confirm our interpretation of their information)

Begin the process right away by creating a copy of the [App Summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ0LyoeWCDYaMsYUQARQ-QyqUPpReVDPUIqQ56uy9S3Hw52v2DBl_PRHgwSEtt4UYVjykT3wxWX8Znw/pub) document:

Begin filling this out right away with the client. This document also needs to be
shared with the delivery team.

> __PRO TIP__: Fill out this document with the client. Share
> your screen as you fill it out. Sharing your notes as you take
> them is a great way to pace a conversation and ensure
> you are collecting information correctly.

__TODO: Create a filled out example__

## Consultancy Policies document

We have a [Consultancy Policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSUcxXideVUG8AgA-Zsmx9sA2knaawPyDENds4orhD98xrFBoexDwHo0yCiYYdTcJ5dOqpM51_qg9gV/pub) document that outlines our policies like PTO and general workplace expectations. This can be shared with the client or the important parts clearly communicated.

 style="width: 640px; height: 300px"></iframe>

## Statement of Work

A statement of work is the contractual agreement between the client and consultant. The  
following is a template of a consulting agreement:

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR6vgDkFd9LjAkVQGTZV7NGU3t8hPk2-vFz5uT2-sISaQn6kouwHOQdTXZ0ba8t1WGPtozxU6sCIM0M/pub?embedded=true" style="width: 640px; height: 300px"></iframe>

While it would be nice if agreements could be signed with a handshake instead of a legal document,
legal documents should be designed to both parties in the event of disagreement. Thus it is __critical__
that these documents be reviewed by delivery before signing. The _detail of service_ section should also be reviewed with the client during the [Client kickoff meeting](#clientkickoffmeeting)

## Internal Kickoff Meeting

After the Statement of Work (SOW) or contract has been signed, an internal
kickoff meeting with the sales and delivery team should be scheduled. The goals of this meeting
are to:

- Ensure the delivery team is fully able to take on the new project
- Prepare the delivery team for the external [client kickoff meeting](#clientkickoffmeeting).

The sales team should ensure:

- [ ] Ensure the Director of Delivery (herein: Director) is aware of the sale and staffing/technical/time requirements.
- [ ] There is a signed Statement Of Work (SOW) or contract.
- [ ] Accounts Receivable has received a copy of the signed SOW and client contact info to setup accounting.

Once completed, the Director should perform the following:

- [ ] Identify the Team Lead(s) and other team members assigned to the project.
- [ ] Inform new team members of the project, role, and start date.
- [ ] Send Accounts Receivable names of new team members to add to Freshbooks project.
- [ ] Schedule an internal kickoff meeting between the sales team, Director, Team Lead, and the team, which should cover:
   - [ ] Project and people introduction (sales team)
   - [ ] Review Consultancy Colicies and App Summary (Director)
   - [ ] Travel needs/availability (Director)
   - [ ] Plans for external kickoff (Director)
- [ ] Schedule inside sales strategy meetings for 3 months from kickoff, recurring every 6 months

## Client Kickoff Meeting

- [ ] Email introduction of the Director (sales team)
- [ ] Confirm receipt of executed contract (Accounts Receivable)
- [ ] Set up management kickoff meeting with client managers and Team Lead (Director). Agenda should include:
   - [ ] Director and Team Lead introduction/explanation of roles
   - [ ] Consultancy Policy review
   - [ ] App Summary review
   - [ ] Set up checkin meetings
   - [ ] Determine if any specific training/orientation is needed by the team
   - [ ] Document how time off should be recorded
- [ ] Set up team introduction meeting (Director). Agenda should include:
   - [ ] Team member introduction
   - [ ] Development methodology
   - [ ] Versioning and environment workflow
   - [ ] Communication tools
