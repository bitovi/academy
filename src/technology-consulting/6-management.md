## Overview

The goal of technology consulting is to deliver value to
your clients. This usually means successful products. There are a wide variety of approaches that attempt to organize work towards successful
outcomes. This article attempts to give a high level overview
of these approaches.

After reading this article, you should be able to :

- Understand the roles and responsibilities of your team.
- Understand the flow of work and decision making from stakeholders to designers,
  development teams, out to customers.
- Identify gaps in project management and work to address them.

This article is __not__ an attempt to provide a detailed training on
any management philosophy.


## Goals

The primary goal of a technology consultant is to add value to your client.

The primary goal of your client _should_ be to add value to
their customers. Therefore, Product Management techniques and methodologies
must also be designed to add value to customers.

__How__ the product or company  adds value should be well understood by everyone throughout
the organization. When everyone understands the goals of the product or company, they
are more likely to make decisions, large or small, that contribute effectively to
the product or company.

These goals are usually encapsulated by the:

- Mission statement
- Performance Indicators
- Strategy statement


### Mission Statement

A [Mission statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_statement) is a
single sentence that describes what the project aspires to be. It should include
a description of how value is added to customers.

<textarea placeholder="What is the product or company's mission statement?" style="width: 640px"></textarea>

Examples:

- _"Perfecting technology delivery for our clients and our community."_ (Bitovi)
- _"Build CRUD apps in fewer lines of code"_. (CanJS)

### Performance Indicators

A [performance indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator) (PI) is
a quantitative measurement that indicates the project has been successful. __Key__
performance indicators (KPIs) tend to be those that most affect the bottom line
directly. Often, it can be worth having additional performance indicators that,
if accomplished, strongly suggest the __key__ performance indicators will
be achieved.

<textarea placeholder="How will the project measure success?" style="width: 640px"></textarea>

Example:

- _KPI: Increase mobile conversion rates to 0.75-1.0%, currently it is ~0.3%._

  _PI: UX study shows 100% purchase completion._

  _PI: Site loads under 1s on 3G._

### Strategy Statement

A strategy statement outlines how you will achieve the
project's goals (performance indicators). It should describe the competitive
advantage the project is looking to create.

<textarea placeholder="What is the strategy for accomplishing the project's goals?" style="width: 640px"></textarea>

Example:

- _Combine the desktop and mobile sites for an improved user experience, site parity, and centralized ownership._



## Product Management


From [Product Manager vs Product Owner](https://medium.com/@melissaperri/product-manager-vs-product-owner-57ff829aa74d), a good Product Manager is taught how to prioritize work against clear outcome oriented goals, how to discover and validate real customer and business value, and what processes are needed to reduce the uncertainty that the product will succeed in market.

## Product Owner

From [Product Manager vs Product Owner](https://medium.com/@melissaperri/product-manager-vs-product-owner-57ff829aa74d), the three main responsibilities of a Product Owner include:

- Define the product backlog and create actionable user stories for the development teams. (Who creates the user stories varies depending on Scrum training)

- Groom and prioritize the work in the backlog.

- Accept the completed user stories to make sure the work fulfills the criteria.
