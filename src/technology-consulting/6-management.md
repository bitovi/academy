## Product Management


From [Product Manager vs Product Owner](https://medium.com/@melissaperri/product-manager-vs-product-owner-57ff829aa74d), a good Product Manager is taught how to prioritize work against clear outcome oriented goals, how to discover and validate real customer and business value, and what processes are needed to reduce the uncertainty that the product will succeed in market.

## Product Owner

From [Product Manager vs Product Owner](https://medium.com/@melissaperri/product-manager-vs-product-owner-57ff829aa74d), the three main responsibilities of a Product Owner include:

- Define the product backlog and create actionable user stories for the development teams. (Who creates the user stories varies depending on Scrum training)

- Groom and prioritize the work in the backlog.

- Accept the completed user stories to make sure the work fulfills the criteria.
