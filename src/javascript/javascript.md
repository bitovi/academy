## Overview

- <em>Audience:</em> Intermediate JS developers.
- <em>Goal:</em> Understand how JavaScript works, what's going on "under the hood".

- [learn-advanced-javascript/js-types] - The types, operators and primitives in JavaScript.
- [learn-advanced-javascript/js-comparison] - How `==` and `===` work.
- [learn-advanced-javascript/closures] - How closures and functions work.
- [learn-advanced-javascript/context] - How `this` works.
- [learn-advanced-javascript/prototypes] - How prototypal inheritance works.
