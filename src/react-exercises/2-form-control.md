## Form Controls

You should have completed (Intro to JSX)[learn-react/intro-to-jsx.html] before attempting these problems.

## Question 1

Make a controlled input component. Wire it up correctly such that when you type into it, it displays what you've typed.

## Question 2

Make a component with two inputs, where whenever you change one of them, the other one changes as well.

## Question 3

Make a component with two inputs, where when you change the one on the left, the right one updates to match, but if you change the right input then they begin to diverge.

## Question 4

Make a textarea, and an button. Whenever you type into the textarea, it makes your characters uppercase, and when you click the button, it clears out the textarea.

## What you've just done

While these may be simple to some, they lock in the details that are necessary for React usage.

1. Gained experience using basic form controls in React.
2. Learned that Textarea have the same functional form as inputs.
3. Gained competency using React in weird situations.
