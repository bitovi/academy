@description Gain experience moving state up or down the component tree.

## State Control

You should have completed (Intro to JSX)[learn-react/components.html] before attempting these problems.

## Question 1

Given a component that is a results list, and another component which is a fancy input, wire them up so that you create a TODO list.

## Question 2

Write a component where, after the component is rendered, it hits an API endpoint, and displays the data.

## Question 3

Phone number formatter. People type digits (it ignores anything that isn't a digit), and it gets formatted correctly when you get to 3, 6, digits.

## What you've just done

While these may be simple to some, they lock in the details that are necessary for React usage.

1. Gained experience moving the state "up" the component tree.
2. Created a React component that made an external API call.
3. Made more complicated state examples.
