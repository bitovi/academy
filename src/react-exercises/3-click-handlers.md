## Click Handlers

You should have completed (Intro to JSX)[learn-react/components.html] before attempting these problems.

## Question 1

Make a component with a box, and a button. When you click the button the box disappears (until you refresh).

## Question 2

Make a component with a box, and every time you click the box, it magically moves 200px to the right.

## Question 3

Make a component with an input box, a submit button, and a box. When the user types in a color as a string or a hex value the box's background is updated to that color. If the input is not a valid hex string, then show it as a default color.

## What you've just done

While these may be simple to some, they lock in the details that are necessary for React usage.

1. Gained experience conditionally rendering HTML.
2. Started tying together React components to do more.
3. Gained more exposure to onClick event handlers.
