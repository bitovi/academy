@description This is a companion course to our "Learn React" course. It builds understanding by completing 30 separate exercises to turn your newfound knowledge of React into practical skill. Every course will start with the lesson that you should have completed in the other tutorial in order to complete these exercises. By the end of this course, you will be able to turn almost any idea into a perfectly written React component.

## Before You Begin

Before beginning this tutorial, you will want to have some familiarity with HTML and [JavaScript](https://www.bitovi.com/academy/learn-advanced-javascript.html). Specifically, you will need to understand [functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions), [objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), and [arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array). Additionally, you should be familiar with some of the more recent [ECMAScript](https://medium.com/sons-of-javascript/javascript-an-introduction-to-es6-1819d0d89a0f) features, such as [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let), [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) and the [rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters). It is also beneficial to have some familiarity with [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/), though it is not strictly necessary to begin. While every lesson will start with the lesson in the [Learn React](https://bitovi.academy/learn-react) course that you should have completed, an alternate way to lock in these skills is to just complete that tutorial in it's entirety and then head on over here and complete this one.

## Why a companion course?

It should come as no surprise that over time people forget things. Things that were learned quickly are the first things to get forgotten as new information is kept. The best way to learn new things and actually keep them is (spaced repetition)[https://elitemedicalprep.com/what-is-spaced-repetition-and-why-is-it-so-important/]. This course aims to provide more practice so that these ideas are hopefully "easy" to think about. It's a workbook of sorts.

## Course Outline

There are 10 lessons in this course and each one contains 3 exercises. The goal is simple. Do them.
