## State Control

You should have completed (Intro to JSX)[learn-react/components.html] before attempting these problems.

## Question 1

Given an array, create an unordered list of the strings in HTML, and a button that when clicked, sorts the list either ascending or descending.

## Question 2

Do the same thing, on a table of data, each column has it's own sort, if you sort a column which is already sorted it changes direction.

## Question 3

Use an array of containing state, city, restaurants to make a series of dropdowns that filters them appropriately.

## What you've just done

While these may be simple to some, they lock in the details that are necessary for React usage.

1. Used arrays effectively in React.
2. Learned how to search, sort, and filter them.

## Next Steps
