## Problem 1: Create Auth Reducers to Update Auth State
With State interface and an initialState ready, we will modify the reducers generated by NgRx Schematics to perform two distinct updates:

Reducers should always return a new state. We are responsible for making sure that a reducer returns a new object instance that represents the State.

    ...state,
    count: state.count + 1
}))
```
