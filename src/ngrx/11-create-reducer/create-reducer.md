> **Quick Start**: You can checkout [this branch](https://github.com/bitovi/angular-ngrx-chat/tree/test-redirect-effects) to get your codebase ready to work on this part.

## Overview

1. Define Login state shape

2. Set Login initial state

3. Update Reducer function to include handler for `LoginActions.loginSuccess` to update Login state

4. Update Reducer function to include handler for `LoginActions.logoutSuccess` to reset Login state

## Problem 3: Create Auth Reducers to Update Auth State

With State interface and an initialState ready, we will modify the reducers generated by NgRx schematics to perform two distinct updates:

- on `loginSuccess` Action, we want the state to be updated with `userId`, `username` and `token` values passed by `loginSuccess` Action;
- on `logout` Action, we want to reset the state to an initial state.

## P3: What You Need to Know

Reducers generated by NgRx schematics:

--todo: show initial reducer--

Reducers should always return a new state. We are responsible for making sure that a reducer returns a new object instance that represents the State.

An example of an Action that returns a new state:

```ts
on(CounterActions.count, (state) => ({
    ...state,
    count: state.count + 1
}))
```
