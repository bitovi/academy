## Overview

TODO

## Problem 1: Create Auth Reducers to Update Auth State

With State interface and an initialState ready, we will modify the reducers generated by NgRx Schematics to perform two distinct updates:

- on `loginSuccess` Action, we want the state to be updated with `userId`, `username` and `token` values passed by `loginSuccess` Action;
- on `logout` Action, we want to reset the state to an initial state.

## P1: What You Need to Know

Reducers generated by NgRx Schematics:

--todo: show initial reducer--

Reducers should always return a new state. We are responsible for making sure that a reducer returns a new object instance that represents the State.

An example of an Action that returns a new state:

```ts
on(CounterActions.count, (state) => ({
    ...state,
    count: state.count + 1
}))
```
