## Git Repository

For the sake of convenience, we've prepared a git repository for you to checkout as a starting point for the upcoming exercises. Each page in this training will contain a link to branches representing the starting point and solution for that part along with a link to a diff showing changes made.

## Setting up your Project

To clone the project repository and check out the `starting-point` branch using the git CLI, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitovi/angular-ngrx-chat.git
git checkout starting-point
```

Next install the project's node dependencies using `npm install`

You now have the project starting point checked out, which includes:

1. An Angular 14 application
2. ESLint and the `@bitovi/eslint-config` package
3. Karma + Jasmine
4. Login and Dashboard UI Components
5. TODO's for needed functionality
