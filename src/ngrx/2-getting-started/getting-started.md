## Git Repository

For the sake of convenience, we've prepared a git repository for you to checkout as a starting point for the upcoming exercises. Each page in this training will contain a link to branches representing the starting point and solution for that part.

## Setting up your Project

To clone the project repository and check out the `starting-point` branch using the git CLI, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitovi/angular-ngrx-chat.git
git checkout starting-point
```

Next install the project's node dependencies using `npm install`
