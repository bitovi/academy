## Before You Begin

This course is the second course in the TypeScript series. At the end of this course, you should be comfortable with any types you come across and possess the knowledge to create your own advanced types. The only prerequisite required is the first course in the TypeScript series found here.

At the end of most sections, there will optional exercises to help solidify the content covered. There are a couple of different ways you can do the exercises; if you have an IDE, you prefer to use the source code for the exercise, along with the prompt, which will be there so you can copy it over. Prefer a more hands-off approach? Each exercise will have a link that will open it in CodeSandbox. The solutions to the exercises are posted below each exercise and hidden by an accordion. There are other ways besides the presented solution. Find one you think is cool and want to share? Drop it in slack!

## Introduction

Advanced TypeScript can be generally stated as finding ways to create types from other types. To do this, TypeScript has many powerful features we can work with from looking up types off of other types to conditionally choosing a type based on another. The course outline goes into further detail about each of the sections.

## Outline

- Typing systems
  - Learn how TypeScript compares types under the hood and some of the ramifications it has.
- Generics with Constraints
  - Learn how to constrain generics to create even more reusable logic.
- Index Accessed Types
  - Learn how to look up types of properties on other types.
- Mapped Types
  - Learn how to iterate through each key of an object type to create new types for those keys.
- Conditional Types
  - Learn how to choose a type base on a passed-in type conditionally.
- Template Literal Types
  - Learn how to make string literals even more powerful.
