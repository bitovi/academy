Hello and welcome to Bitovi Academyâ€™s Learn RxJS training.

This course covers showing an error message if the card number is 
not correct. This exercise is a lot like the previous one.
We will be using the map operator again
to solve this problem. Practice makes perfect.

When complete, you should see an error message right away saying
there is no card.  As you type in numbers, the warning
will say a card needs 16 characters, until you type in 16 numbers,
then the error will go away.
