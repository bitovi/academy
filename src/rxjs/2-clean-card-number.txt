Welcome to Bitovi academy.

This course covers cleaning the card number to remove
spaces and dashes.  Specifically, we will learn how to
map one observable's value to another observable's value.


Our goal is to allow the user to type a card number
with spaces and dashes, but print out a cleaned
up card number without those spaces and dashes.

Notice how CardNumber doesn't have the spaces?

Lets do this!


======


We will do this by creating a `cardNumber` observable on
`AppComponent`  That observable will emit the values of
userCardNumber, but without spaces or dashes.

To do this, we will have to create a `cleanCardNumber`
RxJS operator that maps `userCardNumber` to `cardNumber`.

Finally, we will write out the value of the cleaned up
card number after the form as shown here.
