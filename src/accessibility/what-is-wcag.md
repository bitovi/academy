## Overview
In this section, we are going to build a simple "Hello World" service using [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

NodeJS is not required if you just want to read through this section and copy/paste the code snippets. If you want to run the application natively before we containerize it in the next section, you can install NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## WCAG

What is WCAG? What level do I need to cover?

Overview: https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/

> WCAG 2.2 is scheduled to be published in 2021.

> All requirements in 2.0 and 2.1 will be included in 2.2. The wording of the 2.0 and 2.1 success criteria will be exactly the same in 2.2.



## What's next
Now that we've created a simple NodeJS app, we are going to containerize it.
