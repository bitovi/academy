## Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial, you will want to have some familiarity with CSS and [JavaScript](https://www.bitovi.com/academy/learn-advanced-javascript.html).
Specifically, you will need to understand [functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions), [objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), and [arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).
Additionally, you should be familiar with some of the more recent [ECMAScript](https://medium.com/sons-of-javascript/javascript-an-introduction-to-es6-1819d0d89a0f) features, such as [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let), [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) and the [rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters).

It is also beneficial to have some familiarity with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/), although it is not strictly necessary to begin.

## How to follow this course

This course will walk you through building an application with React Native.
Each page of the guide is based on building a new feature, and may have multiple ‚Äúobjectives‚Äù to complete.
Each objective will be explained and include the requirements and any setup steps needed.
Most objectives will also include unit tests to update to verify when you have implemented the solution correctly.

The ‚úèÔ∏è icon will be used to indicate when commands need to be run or when files need to be created or updated.

If you have any issues or suggestions as you move through this training, we‚Äôd love for you to submit a <a href="https://github.com/bitovi/academy/issues/new">GitHub issue</a> for it! üíñ

## Course outline

This guide begins by walking you through how to [set up an environment](learn-react-native/setting-up-your-environment.html), providing an introduction into [JSX](learn-react-native/intro-to-jsx.html) (JavaScript flavor of XML) and some basic [React Native theory](learn-react-native/components.html).

Once you‚Äôre all setup and oriented into the framework, you‚Äôll learn how to build reusable [components](learn-react-native/building-custom-components.html).
You‚Äôll also learn the various ways of doing [styling](learn-react-native/styling.html), and how CSS can be integrated into JSX.

The second half of the guide will cover more intermediate topics like state management using [Hooks](learn-react-native/managing-state.html) and using `useEffect` to [fetch data](learn-react-native/making-http-requests.html).

Throughout this guide, we‚Äôll be building out a feature-rich Place My Order application, gradually applying all of these concepts to produce a clean and optimized solution!
