## Overview

In this section we'll look at IDEs that have great TypeScript support for building TypeScript projects.

## IDEs

Integrated Development Environments have come a long way in supporting modern web development. With little to no configuration IDEs offer built-in debugging, Git integration, command line usage, and robust packages for additional add-ons.

### Visual Studio Code

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="\_blank">VS Code</a> is Microsoft's modern take on an IDE for app development (P.S. TypeScript is a Microsoft Open Source project).  VS Code has built in TypeScript support for syntax highlighting, IntelliSense code completion, and linting.

Atom is another good modern IDE that easily supports and aids in TypeScript development with the installation of the <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-typeScript" target="\_blank"> atom-typeScript plugin</a>.

### Webstorm

<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/" target="\_blank">Webstorm</a> is a platform by JetBrains that is loved for its great code refactoring assistance and version control integration, but it does require a paid subscription.
