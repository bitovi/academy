Hello and welcome to Bitovi Academy’s Learn TypeScript training.

This video is an overview of the entire TypeScript course.

Before we start, it’s important to make sure everyone knows about Bitovi’s
Community Discord.  It’s a great place to get help on these exercises, and
talk tech with likeminded folks.

So as I mentioned, this course is about TypeScript. TypeScript
adds static typing to JavaScript. The course covers the basics of
TypeScript and works through some examples.

Specifically, we will:

- Learn why you might want to use typescript and
  show an example of compiling it.
- See how to configure typescript and
  what integrated IDE support looks like
- Declare types on variables.
- Define functions to specify their
  arguments and return types.
- Define classes
- Use interfaces to get "loosely" coupled types.
- Use generics to support types as arguments.

Once you’ve completed this course, you will be able to
start building apps in TypeScript.
