## Overview

In this section, we’ll look at IDEs that have great TypeScript support for building TypeScript projects.

## IDEs

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have come a long way in supporting modern web development.
With little to no configuration, IDEs offer built-in debugging, git integration, command line usage, and robust packages for additional add-ons.

### Visual Studio Code

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</a> is Microsoft’s modern take on an IDE for app development (p.s. TypeScript is a Microsoft open source project). VS Code has built in TypeScript support for syntax highlighting, IntelliSense code completion, and linting.

### WebStorm

<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/">WebStorm</a> is a platform by JetBrains that is loved for its great code refactoring assistance and version control integration, but it does require a paid subscription.

### StackBlitz

<a href="https://stackblitz.com/">StackBlitz</a> is a web IDE that’s quick to set up.
It can be run entirely from the browser and it provides features such as linting, code suggestions, etc.
You can start a project easily, but you’ll need to sign in with a GitHub account to save your work.

Next, let’s [set up your local environment](./setting-up-your-environment.html) and create a new TypeScript project.
