## Overview

In this section we’ll look at IDEs that have great TypeScript support for building TypeScript projects.

## IDEs

Integrated Development Environments have come a long way in supporting modern web development. With little to no configuration IDEs offer built-in debugging, Git integration, command line usage, and robust packages for additional add-ons.

### Visual Studio Code

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> is Microsoft’s modern take on an IDE for app development (P.S. TypeScript is a Microsoft Open Source project).  VS Code has built in TypeScript support for syntax highlighting, IntelliSense code completion, and linting.

### Webstorm

<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/">Webstorm</a> is a platform by JetBrains that is loved for its great code refactoring assistance and version control integration, but it does require a paid subscription.
