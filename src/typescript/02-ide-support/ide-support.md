## Overview

In this section we’ll look at IDEs that have great TypeScript support for building TypeScript projects.

## IDEs

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have come a long way in supporting modern web development. With little to no configuration IDEs offer built-in debugging, git integration, command line usage, and robust packages for additional add-ons.

### Visual Studio Code

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</a> is Microsoft’s modern take on an IDE for app development (p.s. TypeScript is a Microsoft open source project). VS Code has built in TypeScript support for syntax highlighting, IntelliSense code completion, and linting.

When the name of a variable is hovered over, VS Code displays a popover with the interface of the variable as well as interface’s implementation so it’s easier to see what is in the interface." />

### WebStorm

<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/">WebStorm</a> is a platform by JetBrains that is loved for its great code refactoring assistance and version control integration, but it does require a paid subscription.

### StackBlitz

<a href="https://stackblitz.com/">StackBlitz</a> is a web IDE that's quick to set up. This can be run entirely from the browser while providing linting and more, similar to VS Code. You can start a project easily, but to save your work you'll need a GitHub account to sign in.
