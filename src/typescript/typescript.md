## Overview

Google chose to write Angular in TypeScript to take advantage of its typechecking magic. While this may mean a bit of a learning curve for new Angular developers, this guide will cover the basics of TypeScript and work through examples to learn to harness the power of TypeScript.

## Outline
- Why TypeScript - learning what TypeScript is and how to compile it.
- IDE Support - configuring TypeScript and learning about different IDEs that help support TypeScript development.
- Types - basic types and how to enforce them. 
- Functions - how to annotate functions parameters and return values, different parameter types available, and how to bind ``this``
- Classes - using classes and inheritance in TypeScript, explaining the ``constructor`` method, and using public, private, protected, and readonly modifiers. 
- Interfaces - writing Interfaces, setting optional properties, and the power of using interfaces in classes and Functions
- Generics - explaining what generics are, why they are useful, and how to create a linked list using generics in TypeScript.
