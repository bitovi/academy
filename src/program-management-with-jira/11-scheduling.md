The Auto-schedule feature can move epics into sprints based on dependencies and 
team velocities. Once an initiative is commited to, you can use the Auto-schedule 
to place the initiative’s epics after work in progress.

For more information on the Auto-scheduler read: [https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/how-does-the-auto-scheduler-in-advanced-roadmaps-work/ "How does the auto-scheduler in advanced roadmaps work."]



## Setting up and using the Auto-scheduler

The following video walk through the steps to set-up and use the Auto-scheduler:

1. <code>[0:48](https://youtu.be/5bcDZFDjKgs?list=PL--xV5crGpX_EdvA-rcDXVC4qjiujYTKE&t=48)</code> Create sprints for each product team

3. <code>[2:03](https://youtu.be/5bcDZFDjKgs?list=PL--xV5crGpX_EdvA-rcDXVC4qjiujYTKE&t=123)</code> Create a <span class="color-purple bold">Shared Team</span> for each product team
4. <code>[2:50](https://youtu.be/5bcDZFDjKgs?list=PL--xV5crGpX_EdvA-rcDXVC4qjiujYTKE&t=170)</code> Create a <span class="color-blue bold">Plan Team</span> for each product team
5. <code>[4:16](https://youtu.be/5bcDZFDjKgs?list=PL--xV5crGpX_EdvA-rcDXVC4qjiujYTKE&t=256)</code> Assign each epic to its <span class="color-blue bold">Plan Team</span>
6. <code>[5:08](https://youtu.be/5bcDZFDjKgs?list=PL--xV5crGpX_EdvA-rcDXVC4qjiujYTKE&t=308)</code> Rank the plan’s epics

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will schedule the epics from the previous section.


### Step 1: Decide who will be responsible for each product team

We will need to set up boards, sprints, shared teams, and plan teams for each product team.  Assign trainees to product teams. It’s ok if multiple people share a product team.

### Step 2: Set up boards, sprints, shared teams, and plan teams.

Trainees should set up the following for each product team:

- A scrum board
- A sprint (make sure to start the sprint)
- Shared team
- Plan team

### Step 3: Assign, Rank, and Schedule Epics

For each initiative, have the trainee who created the initiative:

- Assign the epics to the correct plan team
- Rank the epics so they are in the right order
- Schedule the epics 

Each of these steps should be done one after the other.
