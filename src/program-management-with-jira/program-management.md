## Purpose

In this training, you will learn how to build, maintain, and report on accurate multi-team plans
with Jira. Let's break each part of that down:

- Build - How to take ideas, flesh them out, estimate them, and put them into future plans.
- Maintain - How to keep a plan up to date as development completes and things change.
- Report - How to summarize the plan in an easy-to-digest format for stakeholders and a wider team.
- Accurate - We will use improved modeling of estimates to create more accurate plans.
- Multi-team - How to build plans that coordinates multiple product-teams' work items.

We will build a plan that looks something like the following:

[TODO IMAGE OF ADVANCED PLAN]

And reports that look like:

[TODO IMAGE OF REPORT]

But, the ultimate goal of this training is to teach you how to create __actionable plans__.


## Actionable Plans

_Know the future so that you can change it._

Actionable Plans are plans that have enough accuracy and forward visibility to enable
teams to make changes that affect the plan. These changes might be:

- Restructuring work to avoid blockers
- Better coordinating handoff between teams
- Changing scope
- Exploring alternate solutions
- Adding more resources


Estimating and projecting work takes time. It's _only_ valuable if it actually
has an affect on the project's success. It's important to make sure that your
organization is receptive and responsive to the results of the planning work.

## Before You Begin

You will need a Jira instance with Advanced Plans.  This comes as part of the
premium plan. You can create a trial instance to use this training.

We will setup Jira in [learn-program-management-with-jira/jira-setup].


## Overview

This training imagines you are managing “itsy bitsy marketplace”,
a marketplace that’s a bit like etsy.

You will learn more about the product in [learn-program-management-with-jira/product-overview].

You are tasked with building an actionable plan based on
features that management thinks are a good idea. This is the
evaluation workflow of Bitovi's overall Continuous Exploration workflow.

You are responsible for:

- Exploring and prioritizing feature requests
- Estimating feature requests
- Coordinating the development of features across multiple product teams


In this training, we will:

1. Go over the CX workflow this training establishes.
2. Setup Jira
3. Learn about the product we will be working on
4. Brainstorm new ideas for the product
5. Refine those ideas
6. Discus ways of validating those ideas
7. Estimate those ideas with confidence
8. Prioritize those ideas
9. Plan those ideas into a roadmap
10. Report on those ideas
11. Discuss how to continuously manage this process
