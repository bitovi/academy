Overview
--------

Here is the scenario we will be working with for the rest of this training.

You are the Technical Product Owner for “Itsy Bitsy” marketplace, an online store which specializes in items crafted from spider silk.

You are tasked with building an actionable plan to expand the marketplace past the initial release, based on features that Itsy Bitsy senior management think may be good ideas.

Teams
-----

Itsy Bitsy is a large enterprise comprised of multiple “product” teams:

*   Store
    *   Create a catalog of items 
    *   Manage inventory
    *   Setup pricing
*   Order
    *   Create a cart
    *   Place an order
*   Payment - Support different payment types
*   Shipping - Calculate and price shipping, track shipping
*   Marketing - Creates ads … they are not a product team in the traditional sense
    

Example Feature
---------------

We will be creating the ability to have a simple percentage discount promotion code within Itsy Bitsy. The details of how the promotion code will be created within Itsy Bitsy and applied to orders will be identified as part of our refinement process.

You will also come up with your own ideas for other Itsy Bitsy features and do your own refinement throughout this training.

Roles
-----

*   You - a TPO
*   Trainer - Either a Stakeholder or a Development Lead
