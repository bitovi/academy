## The Refinement List

This is a list of initiatives that you (as some sort of Product / Program / Project person)
have agreed to take on. These should be sorted by priority, with the most important items
at the top.

## Moving items into Refinement

Ideally, the `ideas` list is continuously be sorted during program meetings.
If the team responsible for scoping items has capacity, then items can be moved
into the refinement list. Make sure to assign the person responsible for
scoping the feature.

Generally, you should not accept more than 1-2 initiatives a sprint.

## Sorting the Refinement list

The refinement list should be sorted by each initiative's
expected value, highest value at the top. This won't easily be known at this point, but
use your best judgement.

## What does refined mean?

Refined is ultimately about making sure everyone is on
the same page on the idea. The idea needs to be concrete enough to validate it AND
to estimate it with at least about 50% average certainty.

We generally suggest including the following information from the start:

- __Impact__ - What outcome would you like as a result of this work?
  This should be a value tied to KPIs.

  _Example_: We expect 5% more returning customers.

- __Problem__ - What problem are you trying to solve. This problem should
  relate to a customer or product team problem.

	_Example Customer Problem_: Reoccurring customers want to feel appreciated
	for their repeat business.

	_Example Product Team Problem_: Our product team needs to make
	product decisions based off user data.


As the idea takes on more specifics, we suggest including the following:

- __People__ - Who influences the shape of the story: Stakeholders,
  Engineers, etc.

- __High level user stories__ - What will the user need to do. Include happy
  and negative paths. Ideally, these are coupled with a wireframe.

- __Out of scope items__ - What features will _not_ be included.

- __Considerations__ - Technical or other considerations or assumptions related to the initiative.

- __Questions__ - Questions to be answered.





## Moving items into Refined

As stated above, the first step to moving an item to refined is to get agreement upon
the __impact__ and __problem__.

After that point, the goal is to rapidly identify the [Minimal Marketable Feature](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mmf/) (MMF).

The _Minimal Marketable Feature_ is the smallest iteration of the feature where
some impact can be felt by the customer (or the product team).

To identify the MMF, you want to start with the user journey. This can be
done with a variety of techniques, but the best is generally drawing up
a quick user flow in a white-boarding app like miro or basamiq.

## How to get an initiative to has requirements?
The initiative's feature, from the perspective of all users, should be documented.
A rough wireframe of the functionality should be provided.
The features that are not in scope should be explicitly called out.


## How to sort the has requirements list?
This should be sorted by each initiative's expected value.
