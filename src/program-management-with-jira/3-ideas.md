## What is the unrefined list?

This is a list of initiative ideas that stakeholders and the TPO manage. The ideas are not fully scoped, and therefore can not be estimated or effectively prioritized. However, this list should be prioritized by which ideas are anticipated to create the most value. The highest priority initiatives should be expected to be further developed and moved into has requirements.

## How to get an initiative to unrefined?

Unrefined initiatives are just ideas. Stakeholders can add them at any time.

Ideally, these would be sourced through a `discovery` workflow.

## How to sort the unrefined list?

Once a sprint, this list should be reviewed and reprioritized.


## Exercise

- Come up with some of your own product ideas
- Sort them as a team
