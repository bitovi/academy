## Overview

The ideas backlog is a collection of rough ideas sorted by expected product value.

## What is the `Ideas Backlog` list?

The `Ideas Backlog` is a list of initiative ideas that stakeholders and the TPO manage. The ideas are not fully refined, and therefore can not be estimated or accurately prioritized. However, this list should be prioritized by which ideas are anticipated to create the most value. The highest priority initiatives should be expected to be further developed and moved into `Refinement`.


## How to get an initiative into the `Ideas Backlog`?

Initiatives in the `Ideas Backlog` are just ideas. Anyone can add them at any time.

Ideally, these would be sourced through a `discovery` workflow.

The discovery workflow is a process that looks at:

- Analytics
- Customer feedback
- Competitor research
- User studies

... and synthesizes the quantitative and qualitative data into a picture for the team to think
about and brainstorm.

Those ideas are entered into the backlog with as much data as possible.

## RICE

These make value:

- Reach - How many customers will be impacted in a quarter
- Impact - How much will this impact revenue for those customers.

We include a value confidence:
- Value Confidence


For cost:
- Effort
- Effort Confidence




## Example Idea Initiatives






## How to sort the unrefined list?

Once a sprint, this list should be reviewed and reprioritized.

Add the `reach` and `impact`.


> projected revenue upside score.


## Exercise

- Come up with some of your own product ideas
- Sort them as a team
- Figure out the customers
