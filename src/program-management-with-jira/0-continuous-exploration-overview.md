## Purpose

[Continuous exploration](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/continuous-exploration/)

> Continuous Exploration (CE) is the process that drives innovation and fosters alignment on what should be built by continually exploring market and customer needs, and defining a Vision, Roadmap, and set of Features for a Solution that addresses those needs.
> Â© Scaled Agile, Inc.

A place to explore the ideas/features that lead to what we need.

We call those ideas "initiatives".

It's important to be able to track this. It's important that it's a continuous process.

It's important that it provides visibility.


A workflow.
