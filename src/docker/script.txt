Hello and welcome to Bitovi academy's Learn Docker training. This video is an overview of the entire course.

Before we start, its important that everyone knows about the Bitovi Community Discord. 

It's a great place to ask questions and talk tech with like-minded individuals.

Docker bundles runtime dependencies with application source code into an image - 
This creates a common and repeatable experience 
whether an application is being run on a developer's workstation or a production server. 

In this course, to cover Docker basics, we will be building a simple NodeJS API from scratch and then containerizing it.

Once we have built and run our Docker image, we will explore using volume mounting to make local development of 
containerized applications more efficient. 

Then we will look at how to make our image ready for production and publish it to a package registry.

Finally, we will move on to a more complex example where we orchestrate multiple pre-existing docker images using docker-compose.

Because we are using Docker, you will only need Docker Desktop installed.

I hope you're ready to dive in to Docker with me. Let's get to it.
