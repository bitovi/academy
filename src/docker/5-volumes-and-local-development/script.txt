Welcome to part 6 of Bitovi academies learn doctor training. 

With the concepts we've explored so far, Trying to locally develop a containerized service is very slow. To test every code change, a developer would have to 

In this video we're going to look at volumes
...


When a container is destroyed, any state is lost with it. Docker offers volumes which can be mounted to a container allowing data to be persisted outside of a containers lifecycle.

This is especially useful for running databases in containers, but also allows us to not have to rebuild containers on every code change.

To use volumes, we'll add the -v flag to our `docker run` command

docker run --name my-container -p 8000:8000 -d -v $PWD/src:/app/src my-node-app:latest

mounting our local src directory to the containers /app/src/ directory Allowing changes on either side to be reflected.

Code change

docker logs -f my-container

Thats it! Next we'll be looking at changing up our Dockerfile to make it ready for production
