@description Build an image and run a container for our node app.

## App Review
In the last section, we created a `Dockerfile` for our NodeJS app.
```
FROM node:15

ARG PORT=8000
ENV PORT=$PORT

WORKDIR app
COPY src src
COPY package.json .

RUN npm install
EXPOSE $PORT
CMD npm start
```
At this point, our directory should look like this

![app directory](../static/img/docker/4-build-and-run-image/app-directory.png)

## Build our image
Ensure you have docker desktop running on your machine, then open a terminal to your application directory and run
```
docker build -t my-node-app .
```
- The `-t my-node-app` argument tells Docker to call the image produced by the `Dockerfile` "my-node-app" and tag it as "latest". The "latest" tag is the default tag, but can be overridden when building an image with `:<tagname>`. For example, if we wanted to tag our image as `v1.0.0`, we would run `docker build -t my-node-app:v1.0.0 .`.
- The `.` argument tells Docker where it can find our `Dockerfile`.

Running the above command should produce output similar to below
```
$ docker build -t my-node-app .

## View our image
The `my-node-app:latest` image has been saved to our local Docker registry. Run `docker image ls` and you can see information about it.
```
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
my-node-app         latest              848464f1725a        5 seconds ago       944MB
node                15                  b34e90f5c9c0        24 hours ago        935MB
```
You'll notice there's also a `node:15` image in our registry. This is because we defined it as our base image in our `Dockerfile` (`FROM node:15`). It was pulled from Dockerhub so it can be used locally.

## Run our image
We're finally ready to run our image. Open a terminal and run
```
docker run --name my-container -p 8000:8000 -d my-node-app:latest
```
- `--name my-container` gives our container a friendly name. If this is not provided, Docker will name the container for you.
- `-p 8000:8000` publishes the container's internal port 8000 to our host machine's port 8000. This will allow us to access the app from `localhost:8000`
- `-d` runs the container in detached mode. This runs the process as a background process.
- `my-node-app:latest` specifies what image we want to run. If this image does not exist in our local registry, Docker will try and find and download a match from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/).

Running the above command should produce output similar to below
```
$ docker run --name my-container -p 8000:8000 -d my-node-app:latest
71cfe418a26a05bbebb160f541e53c025157dc7ee2c333ab2309c7bc66bb24e3
```
Open your browser to `localhost:8000` and you should see `Hello World!`. You just ran your first docker image!

## Interacting with our container
Run `docker ps` to see the status of all running containers
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
71cfe418a26a        my-node-app:latest   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   my-container
```
You can view logs with `docker logs <container-name>`
```
$ docker logs my-container

> bitovi-academy-app@1.0.0 start
> nodemon src/index.js

[nodemon] 2.0.6
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node src/index.js index.js`
Example app listening at http://localhost:8000
```
Finally, stop our container with `docker stop <container-name>` and `docker rm <container-name>`. If you want to do this with one command, just run `docker rm -f <container-name>`.
```
$ docker rm -f my-container
my-container

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

```

## Customize the port
We can use the `-e` flag when starting our container to set the `PORT` environment variable.
```
$ MY_PORT=9000
$ docker run --name my-container -p 8000:$MY_PORT -d -e PORT=$MY_PORT my-node-app:latest
0c0a51e7a19f37d503452892df9498de18c5dc78719aae2511b42a32f1f734ad

$ docker logs my-container

> bitovi-academy-app@1.0.0 start
> nodemon src/index.js

[nodemon] 2.0.6
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node src/index.js index.js`
Example app listening at http://localhost:9000
```
You'll see the last line of the logs indicating the app is now listening on port 9000. However, because we set the port mapping with `-p 8000:9000`, we still will view the application in our browser from `localhost:8000`.

## Review
We've built an image and run a container for our node app. Here's a cheat sheet of all the commands we ran.
```
# Build an image
docker build -t my-node-app .

# Build an image with a custom tag
docker build -t my-node-app:v1.0.0 .

# List images in registry
docker image ls

# Create a container
docker run --name my-container -p 8000:$MY_PORT -d -e PORT=$MY_PORT my-node-app:latest

# List running containers
docker ps

# View container logs
docker logs <container-name>

# Kill a container
docker rm -f <container-name>
```
Next we'll look at introducing storage mounts to make local application development efficient.
