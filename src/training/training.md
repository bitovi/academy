## Overview

It's difficult to give a training!

Trainings are intense. They usually
are performed contiguously, forcing trainees to continually learn
in a very rapid manner.

Trainees have a variety of experience.  It's hard to make trainings
interesting and informative for everyone.  Experienced people might
find it boring and inexperienced people might find it too difficult.

This course will try to solve these problems so you can
have a successful training.

## In the weeks before the training

- <input type="checkbox"/> Confirm the date, time and location of the meeting space.
- <input type="checkbox"/> Get email of attendees.
- <input type="checkbox"/> Look on [bitovi/univerisy](https://github.com/bitovi/training/issues) for issues to fix.
- <input type="checkbox"/> Share the [training outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ehhhfqWTKJBsrvvnZXCd8BxH56gbdjFKd36-U8fLdlo/edit#) with the team.

## Before you leave for the training


- <input type="checkbox"/> Bring swag, snacks, or candy.
- <input type="checkbox"/> Print out cheat sheets

## Introduction

1. Introduce yourself and the plan for the week.

   - Share a link to the training material.
   - Get people in slack.
   - Get people installing anything they need.

2. Let people know that the training will be hard
   and that they should ask questions.

   > This week will be hard. There's a lot to learn about X, Y, Z.
   > Some of you might find it very challenging, others might find it boring.
   > To those who find it boring, this can be a great time to spread knowledge
   > around, share your knowledge.  Help other people.  And even
   > learn how we give this training so you can use it to teach others.
   > (All this material is available online.)
   >
   > The most important thing is to ask questions. There are
   > no stupid questions.  In fact, I think my strength as a developer
   > is entirely built around being unafraid to get help and ask questions.
   > I'll happily repeat myself in different ways to explain something better.

3. Get introductions from the trainees.

   Go around and ask trainees name, what they want to learn,
   where they are from, and something fun about them.



## While Training

- Bring the energy! Training can be long and tiresome. We need to keep it
  exciting.  Lame jokes are better than boring.
- Repeatedly ask "Does anyone need help?"
- Set a timer for exercises.
  - Pass out cups, have people flip them over when they complete an
    exercise.
- Create issues when mistakes or improvements can be made.


## Finishing the training

- Ask people to provide feedback `contact@bitovi.com` or issues.
- Ask people if there are other trainings they would like.
- Ask people to recommend these trainings to other colleges if they
  enjoyed the training.
