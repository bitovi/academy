    <p>A large part of being successful as a consultant is building trust and rapport with your client. If a client trusts and likes you, you will gain influence. The more influence you have, the easier it will be to impact key decisions at key moments.</p>
<p>We’re no experts at schmoozing, but the following are helpful tips towards building trust and rapport with anyone.</p>
<h2>Trust</h2>
<p><strong>Trust</strong> is someone’s confidence in or reliance on you to get the job done. Trust is earned over time through consistent actions and can be easily lost. Ultimately, delivering what you promise — on time and within budget — is the best way to increase trust.</p>
<p>On a perfect project, that’s easy. But in reality, projects rarely run that smooth. The following strategies are ways to boost the trust on a project when things aren’t perfect.</p>
<p>Building trust and rapport with clients is fundamental for successful consulting. Trust is the confidence clients have in your honesty and reliability, while rapport is a positive relationship marked by mutual understanding and good communication. These elements are crucial for fostering strong client relationships, which, in turn, lead to better project outcomes, smoother communication, and higher client retention rates. When clients trust and like you, your influence grows, making it easier to impact key decisions at crucial moments.</p>
<h3>Easiest way to build trust</h3>
<p>Fortunately, clients understand that things aren’t always perfect. But as technology consultants, it’s up to us to communicate problems, questions, and concerns to clients. When you are up front and honest with clients, it builds trust that you are doing the right thing. Similarly, it’s important to set expectations so you can meet them. A client will trust you more if you regularly deliver early vs. being consistently late.</p>
<p>These are so important they have their own trainings!</p>

</ul>
<p>Establishing and maintaining credibility is essential for long-term success as a consultant. Credibility ensures that clients trust your expertise and rely on your advice. Here are key strategies to build and sustain your credibility:</p>
<p>To establish trust quickly and effectively, follow these core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be up front and honest:</strong> Clients appreciate transparency, especially when problems arise. Communicate issues, questions, and concerns openly. This honesty demonstrates your commitment to doing the right thing and builds trust.</li>
<li><strong>Set realistic expectations:</strong> Always set achievable expectations. Consistently delivering on or before deadlines fosters trust, as clients see you as reliable and competent.</li>
<li><strong>Follow through on promises:</strong> Ensure you fulfill your commitments on time. Consistently doing what you say you’ll do reinforces your reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Align actions with words:</strong> Ensure that what you say matches what you do. Consistency between your promises and actions builds trust.</li>
<li><strong>Regular updates:</strong> Provide regular and accurate updates to keep the client informed about the project’s status. Avoid surprises by communicating openly about any changes or issues.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Be someone the client can count on. Meet deadlines, attend meetings on time, and deliver on your commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Honesty:</strong> Always be honest about what you can do and how long it will take. If you encounter obstacles, be upfront about them.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Share both good and bad news with the client. Clients appreciate transparency and are more likely to trust you if they feel you are being candid.</li>
<li><strong>Admit mistakes:</strong> If you make a mistake, acknowledge it quickly and work on a solution. Taking responsibility shows integrity and a commitment to excellence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a “disclosure sandwich” technique: state the positive context, share the challenge transparently, and then outline your proposed solution.</li>
<li>Break down tasks into smaller deliverables with buffer time included, and communicate these milestones to clients.</li>
<li>Implement a personal tracking system (e.g., a to-do list app) to ensure all promises are logged and deadlines are met.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Remember that you share common goals</h3>
<p>When consultants are added to a project, it’s common for an &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality to develop. This can lead to conflict and reduced trust, especially amongst client peers that may not understand why you’re there. It’s important to communicate early and often to the team that you share common goals. Refer to the <a href="transitioning-to-delivery.html#engagement-summary-document" title="Learn how to successfully transition a project from the sales team to the delivery team.">Engagement Summary Document</a> that was created at the start of the project to refresh on the product’s goals.</p>
<p>Building a collaborative environment is key to overcoming the “us vs. them” mentality that can develop when consultants join a project.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combat the “us vs. them” mentality:</strong> Clearly communicate early and often that you share common goals with the team. Emphasize collaboration to build a unified front.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement Summary Document:</strong> Regularly refer to the Engagement Summary Document created at the start of the project to remind everyone of the shared objectives and reinforce the common goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>During meetings, emphasize collaborative language like “we” and “our goals” instead of “you” and “your project.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Speak up about things that employees are silent about</h3>
<p>Employees are often operating in fear. Fear of stepping on someone’s toes, getting reprimanded or fired, saying the wrong thing and feeling embarrassed, etc.</p>
<p>Be courageous and speak out openly about the problems you see that stand in the way of success. Organizational problems, dogmatic process, bad UX, etc. Of course be polite and respectful, but don’t be afraid to say what’s wrong.</p>
<p>In the process of speaking honestly, clients tend to develop more and more trust in you, since you’re providing rare insights.</p>
<p>For the Bitovians refreshing their consulting skills: Bitovi will never fire an employee for speaking truth to power, so take advantage of it!</p>
<p>As a consultant, your external perspective is valuable. Use this advantage to address issues that internal employees might be hesitant to discuss.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be courageous:</strong> Speak openly about problems that hinder success. Provide honest and respectful feedback on organizational issues, processes, and UX. This approach shows your commitment to the project’s success.</li>
<li><strong>Company culture:</strong> Reinforce that honest feedback is valued and encouraged within your organization.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive exercise:</strong> Practice giving constructive feedback in various scenarios through role-playing exercises, enhancing your ability to handle sensitive topics effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frame feedback in terms of potential benefits: “I noticed this issue, and addressing it could really improve our efficiency.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Making a great first impression</h3>
<p>First impressions are critical in setting the tone for your relationship with the client. A positive first impression demonstrates your capability, dependability, and professionalism.</p>
<p>First impressions are formed quickly and can have a lasting impact on how the client perceives you throughout the project. A strong first impression builds a foundation of trust and sets the stage for a productive working relationship.</p>
<p>Here are key strategies to ensure you make a great first impression:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dress the part:</strong> Wear business casual attire for your initial meeting, whether in-person or virtual. Adjust your attire to align with the client’s workplace culture subsequently.</li>
<li><strong>Be punctual:</strong> Arrive on time for meetings, whether they are in-person or virtual. Being punctual shows respect for the client’s time and demonstrates reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Open gestures:</strong> Use open and approachable body language. Avoid crossing your arms, which can appear defensive.</li>
<li><strong>Eye contact:</strong> Maintain eye contact to show you are engaged and interested in the conversation. It conveys confidence and honesty.</li>
<li><strong>Attentiveness:</strong> Nod and use other small gestures to show you are actively listening. Lean in slightly to show your interest and engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Video presence:</strong> When meeting virtually, always have your video camera on. This helps create a more personal connection.</li>
<li><strong>Good lighting:</strong> Ensure you have good lighting so your face is clearly visible. Natural light is best, but a well-placed lamp can also work.</li>
<li><strong>Centered in frame:</strong> Position yourself in the center of the frame, with your face clearly visible. Avoid distracting backgrounds or ensure a virtual background is appropriate and professional.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare a brief, engaging introduction that includes a unique fact about yourself to make you memorable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Effective communication skills</h3>
<p>Here’s are some key ways to communicate effectively:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listen attentively:</strong> Show understanding by nodding, summarizing points, and asking clarifying questions. This demonstrates that you value the client’s input.</li>
<li><strong>Be clear and concise:</strong> Speak plainly and to the point to avoid confusion and ensure your message is understood.</li>
<li><strong>Show empathy:</strong> Let your communication reflect that you understand and care about the client’s feelings and concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Keep them updated:</strong> Regularly update the client on project progress and any changes to maintain transparency and build trust.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive practice:</strong> Role-play scenarios to practice active listening and clear communication, refining your skills in real-time interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the “echo” technique: repeat back what the client says to confirm understanding before responding.</li>
<li>Acknowledge the client’s concerns with statements like “I understand how XYZ is frustrating because…” before offering solutions.</li>
<li>Set a regular schedule for updates (e.g. weekly status emails) and stick to it, even if there are no major changes to report.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Building credibility</h3>
<p>Establishing credibility is essential for gaining and maintaining the client’s trust.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show your expertise:</strong> Share relevant knowledge and past experiences that address the client’s needs. This demonstrates your capability and builds confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> Ensure your actions match your words. Following through on promises and commitments is critical.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain integrity:</strong> Always be honest about what you can do and how long it will take. This honesty reinforces your reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Case studies:</strong> Review real-world examples of credibility-building to understand effective strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive exercise:</strong> Analyze case studies and identify key credibility-building actions, enhancing your ability to apply these principles in your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re not sure of an answer, maintain integrity by saying “I’m not sure, let me get back to you by tomorrow on that.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using technology to enhance trust</h3>
<p>Leveraging technology effectively can significantly enhance trust between you and your clients. By using the right tools and practices, you can improve communication, protect sensitive information, and provide transparency in project management.</p>
<p>Here are key ways to use technology to build and maintain trust:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure document sharing:</strong> Use Google Drive (or the client’s preferred tool) with proper access controls to ensure that sensitive documents are only accessible to authorized individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Password management:</strong> Use 1Password (or the client’s preferred tool) to securely share credentials with clients. Do not trust Slack (or any other chat tool) with secrets because all messages may be logged or retained.</li>
<li><strong>Task management software:</strong> Keep the project’s task management software (e.g. Jira) up to date. This allows clients to track progress in real-time, providing transparency and reassurance.</li>
<li><strong>Regular updates:</strong> Use these tools to provide regular updates and document any changes or issues that arise. Consistent communication through these platforms can help build trust and manage expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Training and support:</strong> If a client isn’t familiar with a tool, offer to walk them through it and share documentation to help them understand and use the technology effectively. This can help them feel more comfortable and confident in the tools you are using.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provide training sessions:</strong> Offer scheduled training sessions for clients to help them get acquainted with new tools and technologies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on a past project where you felt trust was strong between you and the client. What specific actions or behaviors contributed to building that trust?</li>
<li>How do you differentiate between trust and rapport in your professional relationships? Can you give an example where you experienced one without the other?</li>
<li>Think about a time when trust was broken in a professional setting. How was it handled, and what were the outcomes?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rapport</h2>
<p>All consultants should have <strong>rapport</strong> with their clients — a relationship of trust and respect. Building trust is a key component of this, but it’s also important that your client enjoys working with you. The following strategies can help build and improve your relationship with your client.</p>
<p>Rapport is the foundation of a strong, positive relationship characterized by mutual understanding and effective communication.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compare and contrast:</strong> Trust is about the client’s confidence in you, while rapport is about the quality of your relationship with the client.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on client relationships:</strong> Building trust and rapport improves communication, streamlines projects, and increases client retention.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Face time</h3>
<p>It’s 10x easier to build rapport in person than it is over the Internet. We’ve found that meeting a person in the first weeks of a project makes the rest of the project go smoother. Find a way to meet in person whenever possible, especially for critical points in a project’s lifecycle (e.g. the start of a project).</p>
<p>If you find yourself unable to meet in person, make time to have one-on-one’s on a consistent interval, like once every one or two weeks. We have also found just reaching out for a second opinion leads to an increase in trust in you and your work output.</p>
<p>Spending time with clients, whether in-person or virtually, is essential for building rapport.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-person meetings:</strong> Meeting clients in person early in the project is highly effective for building rapport. Whenever possible, meet in person, especially at critical points in the project lifecycle. If in-person meetings aren’t possible, regular one-on-ones are crucial.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent one-on-ones:</strong> Schedule regular one-on-one meetings, ideally once every one or two weeks, to maintain a strong connection.</li>
<li><strong>Reach out for second opinions:</strong> Use these opportunities to increase trust in your work output by seeking feedback and second opinions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your first in-person meeting to include a mix of business and casual conversation to establish a personal connection.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-work bonding time</h3>
<p>When meeting with clients, use the opportunity to get to know the person outside work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remote interactions:</strong> Use the quiet time at the beginning of meetings to ask about their day and engage in small talk.</li>
<li><strong>In-person interactions:</strong> Invite clients to lunch, dinner, drinks, or coffee, just to get to know them. While you’re there, try to learn 3 things about them not at all related to their career. Write it down and share it with others on your team.</li>
</ul>

<li>How do you encourage your team members to take ownership of their tasks?</li>
<li>Describe a time when recognizing a team member’s contribution positively impacted the team’s morale.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reflect and Improve Continuously</h3>
<p>Regular reflection and feedback are essential for continuous improvement and project success.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review milestones:</strong> Regularly check progress at key points to ensure the project is on track and make necessary adjustments. Milestone reviews help in reassessing project direction and priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Conduct retrospectives:</strong> After completing project phases or the entire project, gather insights on what went well and areas for improvement. Use this feedback to refine processes and practices.</li>
<li><strong>Implement feedback:</strong> Use feedback from retrospectives to continuously improve. Document lessons learned and apply them to future projects.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>Exercise</h4>

<h3>Connect Individual Efforts to Business Outcomes</h3>
<p>Helping your team understand how their daily work contributes to broader business goals reinforces the importance of their contributions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link daily tasks to strategic goals:</strong> Show how everyday tasks contribute to the company’s success, helping team members see the bigger picture. For example, explain how improving a user interface can lead to better user retention and increased revenue.</li>
