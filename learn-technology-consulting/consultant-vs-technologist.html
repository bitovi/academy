    <h2>Being a Consultant (not just a domain expert)</h2>
<p>At Bitovi, we pride ourselves in being able to deliver more than just staff augmentation. Being a consultant means understanding and engaging with the client’s broader business context, building strong relationships, asking insightful questions, and providing tailored solutions. Your role is to be a partner to the client, offering expertise that goes beyond fulfilling tasks to include strategic thinking and problem-solving.</p>
<h3>Common roles on software projects</h3>
<p>There are <em>many</em> roles on software projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client Stakeholder</strong>: Represents the client’s interests, provides feedback, and approves deliverables.</li>
<li><strong>Project Manager (PM)</strong>: Oversees the project, ensuring it stays on schedule, within budget, and meets the client’s requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Product Owner (PO)</strong>: Defines the product vision and prioritizes the product backlog to ensure the development team delivers maximum value.</li>
<li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: Facilitates Agile ceremonies, removes impediments, and supports the team in following Scrum practices.</li>
<li><strong>Backend</strong>: Develops server-side logic, databases, and APIs, ensuring the application’s functionality and performance.</li>
<li><strong>DevOps</strong>: Manages deployment processes, infrastructure, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.</li>
<li><strong>Frontend</strong>: Implements the user interface and client-side logic, ensuring a responsive and accessible web application.</li>
<li><strong>Product Design</strong>: Designs the user interface and experience, focusing on usability, aesthetics, and overall user satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>QA/QE</strong>: Tests the application to identify bugs, ensure functionality, and verify that requirements are met.</li>
<li><strong>Business Analyst (BA)</strong>: Gathers requirements, documents processes, and ensures the solution meets business needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a consultant, you are expected to be an expert in one of these roles, but being a consultant is a lot more than just being a domain expert.</p>
<h3>Understand the role of a consultant</h3>
<p><strong>Expand beyond domain expertise:</strong> Recognize that your role is not just about completing tasks. You are a trusted advisor working on solutions that address real-world problems and deliver significant value.</p>
<p><strong>Build client partnerships:</strong> View yourself as a partner, not just a service provider. Collaborate closely with clients to understand their vision, mission, and strategic goals. This knowledge will guide your technical decisions and ensure your contributions are strategically beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>Care deeply about results:</strong> A key difference between great and average consultants is genuinely caring about making the project successful. Show your dedication, and others who care will be attracted to you and respect you, opening doors for further opportunities.</p>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active listening:</strong> Practice active listening by summarizing client needs and concerns in your own words to ensure understanding.</li>
<li><strong>KPIs alignment:</strong> Work with your client to define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that measure the success of your solutions in business terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on a recent project. How did your role extend beyond providing domain expertise?</li>
<li>What strategies can you use to position yourself as a trusted advisor rather than just a service provider?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Grasp the business context</h3>
<p>Understanding the client’s business context is crucial for delivering impactful work. By comprehending the client’s product, market, and customer base, you can better align your contributions with their broader goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Learn about the client/product/customer/project:</strong> Before diving into tasks, invest time in learning about the client’s business, their product, the market they operate in, and their customers. This understanding will enable you to tailor your work for maximum positive impact.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contextualize your work:</strong> Always consider how your work affects the client, customer, or project. For example, a frontend developer should think about how a new feature enhances user experience, aligns with business objectives, and meets customer needs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Ask questions and listen</h3>
<p>Ask thoughtful questions to understand the tasks at hand and the rationale behind them. This ensures that your implementation or solution is not just correct but also aligned with the client’s goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand the purpose:</strong> Ask why a task is important and how it fits into the bigger picture. This not only clarifies your understanding but also demonstrates your interest in contributing to the client’s success.</li>
<li><strong>Identify key roles</strong>: Find out who is responsible for various aspects such as project management, design, UX research, understanding customers, etc. Engage with these individuals to gain insights that can inform your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Active listening is vital for understanding the client’s needs, concerns, and expectations. It involves fully concentrating, understanding, responding, and remembering what the client says.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listen to understand</strong>: Pay close attention during client interactions, and show that you value their input. Reflect back what you hear to confirm understanding and clarify any ambiguities.</li>
<li><strong>Address concerns</strong>: Use the insights gained from listening to address client concerns proactively and to tailor your solutions to better meet their needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solve problems</h3>
<p>As a consultant, your goal is to solve problems and empower clients to make informed decisions. This means thinking critically about the challenges they face and offering practical, well-considered advice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consider multiple options:</strong> When presented with a problem, don’t just accept it at face value. Consider various solutions, weighing their pros and cons, and how they align with the client’s goals.</li>
<li><strong>Address root causes:</strong> Focus on solving the underlying problems rather than just the symptoms. This approach not only resolves the immediate problem but can also prevent future occurrences.</li>
<li><strong>Get creative:</strong> There are almost certainly multiple solutions to every problem. Brainstorm ideas with your teammates to think outside the box and find opportunties in constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Think holistically:</strong> Consider the big picture, understanding how different parts of a system interact and affect the business. Evaluate the interdependencies and potential ripple effects of your solutions, ensuring they align with the client’s overall strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Empower clients to make decisions</strong>: Provide clients with the information they need to make decisions. This includes presenting different options, explaining the implications of each, and recommending the best course of action based on your expertise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge transfer sessions:</strong> Hold knowledge transfer meetings where you train your client on tools and processes, empowering them to take ownership.</li>
<li><strong>Use the “Five Whys” technique:</strong> “Five Whys” ecnourages thoughtful thinking by drilling down into the reasons behind a task or requirement, ensuring you understand the core purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe a time when you had to adjust your solution to better meet your client’s needs.</li>
<li>What techniques do you use to empower your client to actively participate in the design, management, or technical process?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advocate for best practices</h3>
<p><strong>Lead by example:</strong> Demonstrate best practices in your own work. This not only improves the product but can also be a reference to share what implementing best practices looks like.</p>
<p>By holding yourself to a high standard in your own work, you set a benchmark for quality and excellence that your team can aspire to.</p>
<p><strong>Explain your reasoning:</strong> Help clients understand the rationale behind your recommendations, making them advocates for best practices. Explain the benefits of following best practices and how they can positively impact the project and business outcomes.</p>
<p>How to offer strategic advisory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the client’s project and suggest updates to better meet project needs and support growth. Conduct thorough assessments and provide clear, actionable recommendations.</li>
<li>Create proofs of concept to demonstrate how different solutions perform under specific conditions. This helps your client visualize potential solutions and make informed decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build connections</strong>: Develop rapport with key client stakeholders through regular communication and collaboration. This could involve informal catch-ups, joint problem-solving sessions, or simply being approachable and responsive. Strong relationships enable you to propose and implement changes more effectively. When stakeholders trust you, they are more likely to consider and support your recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Conduct education sessions:</strong> Hold sessions to update clients on the latest in technologies and best practices, showing how these can benefit their business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you demonstrate best practices in your work?</li>
<li>Describe a situation where you had to guide a client to understand the rationale behind your recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Manage scope, timeline, and risks</h3>
<p>Effectively manage project boundaries and expectations to avoid scope creep and ensure successful outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly document project scopes in detail. Use project charters, scope statements, and detailed plans to define the project’s boundaries.</li>
<li>Use formal processes to handle scope changes, always with client approval. Establish change control procedures to manage and approve any alterations to the project scope.</li>
<li>Regularly explain the impact of scope changes to the client. Communicate the implications of any changes on the project’s timeline, budget, and outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to proactively manage risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify potential risks early and develop mitigation strategies. Use risk management techniques such as risk assessments and contingency planning.</li>
<li>Conduct regular risk assessments and update mitigation plans as necessary. Continuously monitor and reassess risks throughout the project lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of issues and challenges on projects as opportunities to show problem-solving skills and the value you can provide to clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use problem-solving frameworks and issue tracking tools to stay on top of challenges. Tools like root cause analysis and issue logs can help manage and resolve problems systematically.</li>
<li>After resolving any crisis, review what happened with your team to prevent future issues. Conduct post-mortem analyses and implement lessons learned to improve future performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Refer to the Engagement Summary Document:</strong> Regularly refer to the <a href="transitioning-to-delivery.html#engagement-summary-document" title="Learn how to successfully transition a project from the sales team to the delivery team.">Engagement Summary Document</a> created at the start of the project to remind everyone of the shared objectives and reinforce the common goals.</li>
<li><strong>Change request process:</strong> Implement a formal change request process to manage and document any alterations to the project scope.</li>
<li><strong>Root Cause Analysis (RCA):</strong> Use root cause analysis techniques (e.g. Five Whys) to identify and address the underlying causes of issues.</li>
<li><strong>Post-mortem reviews:</strong> Conduct post-mortem reviews after major issues to learn from them and prevent recurrence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you describe a situation where you successfully managed scope changes?</li>
<li>What strategies do you use to proactively manage risks in a project?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Uphold ethics and professionalism</h3>
<p><strong>Maintaining confidentiality and integrity:</strong> Handle sensitive information with care and maintain the highest level of professionalism. Make sure that client data and intellectual property are protected and handled ethically.</p>
<p><strong>Committing to ethical standards:</strong> Adhere to the highest ethical standards in every action and decision, building trust and credibility with clients. Be transparent, honest, and accountable in all your dealings, reinforcing the client’s confidence in your integrity.</p>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you provide an example of how you adhered to ethical standards in a challenging situation?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>You are part of a project kick-off meeting where the client outlines several tasks they want completed. One task seems unnecessary and could be a potential time drain. How would you handle this situation?</p>
<p><details>
<summary>Guidance</summary></p>
<ul>
<li>Use active listening to fully understand the client’s request. Reflect back what you hear to confirm understanding.</li>
<li>Ask why the task is important and how it fits into the bigger picture. Use the “Five Whys” technique to uncover the root purpose.</li>
<li>Suggest alternative approaches if the task seems misaligned with project goals, providing clear reasons and potential benefits.</li>
<li>Make sure the client feels heard and valued, and collaboratively decide the best course of action.</li>
</ul>
<p></details></p>
<h2>Understanding the client, customer, product, and project</h2>
<p>When starting work on a new project, there are a few different parts of the entire project that you should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Client:</strong> This refers to the company you’re working with, including their industry, operations, market position, and strategic goals. Understanding the client involves knowing their business model, organizational structure, and key decision-makers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> The software applications or services provided to end-users. This includes the features, functionalities, and the value proposition of the product. Knowing the product thoroughly helps in identifying areas for improvement and innovation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Customer:</strong> The end-users who interact with the software. Understanding their needs, preferences, and pain points is crucial for delivering a product that meets or exceeds expectations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project:</strong> The client’s goals to enhance the software to better meet customer needs and drive business success. This encompasses the project’s scope, objectives, timelines, and deliverables.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding the client</h3>
<p>A deep understanding of the client is fundamental to effective consulting. In this section, we’ll dig into understanding the client you’re working with.</p>
<h4>Joining a new client with a Bitovi Principal</h4>
<p>You should be equipped with a comprehensive understanding of the client’s business:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Clear vision, challenges, and expectations:</strong> Get a detailed briefing from the Principal about the client’s overall vision, the specific business challenges they face, and the expectations for how the consultant can support their broader business goals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Past, current, and future initiatives:</strong> Gain insight into the client’s past and current business strategies. This includes understanding previous initiatives, successes, failures, and lessons learned to better align your contributions with their business goals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Revenue streams:</strong> Identify the primary sources of revenue for the client. Is the project a cost center or profit center for the company?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SWOT analysis:</strong> Conduct a SWOT analysis to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the client’s business. This helps in forming a strategic approach to support their objectives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these elements are missing, the Principal or Consultant should take proactive steps to gather this information.</p>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Meet with key stakeholders:</strong> Having a conversation with key stakeholders will show them you’re interested in understanding their business and building a relationship. This will give you an opportunity to learn from their experiences and perspectives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ask clarifying questions:</strong> Don’t hesitate to ask for clarification on any point that seems unclear. It’s better to ask questions early than to make incorrect assumptions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the client’s main business goals, and how does this project align with them?</li>
<li>What are the specific pain points the client is facing with this project?</li>
<li>How will success be measured for this project?</li>
</ul>
<h4>SWOT analysis</h4>
<p>A SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to identify and evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to a business or project.</p>
<ul>

<h3>Understanding the product</h3>
<p>By thoroughly analyzing the product, its market, and the client’s goals, you can provide valuable insights and recommendations that align with the client’s strategic vision.</p>
<h4>Initial product analysis</h4>
<p><strong>Determine core purpose:</strong> Start by identifying the main functionality of the product. What problem does it solve, and how does it serve its users? Clarifying the core purpose helps ensure that all subsequent development efforts stay aligned with this primary goal.</p>
<p>For example, if the product is a project management tool, its core purpose might be to streamline project tracking and team collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Identify target audience:</strong> Understanding who will use the product is crucial. Look at demographic data, user needs, and behaviors. Pinpointing the audience allows for more tailored features and user experiences.</p>
<p>For instance, a product designed for busy professionals should emphasize ease of use and quick access to essential functions.</p>
<p><strong>Highlight uniqueness:</strong> Emphasize what sets the product apart from competitors. This could be proprietary features, unique integrations, or specific capabilities that others lack.</p>
<p>Identifying these unique aspects can help in marketing and further development to maintain a competitive edge.</p>
<p><strong>Determine if it’s a profit or cost center:</strong> Assess whether the product functions as a profit center or a cost center. A profit center generates revenue directly through sales, subscriptions, or other means. In contrast, a cost center supports internal operations without directly generating revenue but may lead to cost savings or improved efficiency. Understanding this distinction helps in setting financial expectations, budgeting, and strategic planning.</p>
<p>For instance, a customer relationship management (CRM) system sold to other businesses is a profit center, whereas an internal HR management tool used to streamline employee processes is typically a cost center.</p>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the core functionalities of the product you’re currently working on, and how do they address the primary needs of the target audience?</li>
<li>Is the product intended to be a profit center or a cost center, and how does this impact its development and marketing strategies?</li>

</ul>
<p>Use performance dashboards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build dashboards:</strong> Create dynamic dashboards reflecting real-time data on product performance. Dashboards should highlight key metrics and provide an at-a-glance view of progress.</li>

<h3>Understanding the customer</h3>
<p>When you really understand the client’s customer, you can help create solutions that truly meet their needs.</p>
<h4>Determine the target audience type</h4>
<p>Knowing who your audience is helps you tailor your approach to their specific needs.</p>
<p><strong>Categorize the audience:</strong> Figure out if the audience is B2B (business-to-business), B2C (business-to-consumer), or internal employees. This affects how the client should design, function, and communicate about their product.</p>
<p>For example, B2B products might need strong data integration and have different priorities than B2C products, which often focus more on looks and ease of use.</p>
<p><strong>Understand the audience’s priorities:</strong> Look at how the type of audience affects your product’s design and functionality.</p>
<p>For example, tools for employees might prioritize efficiency and integration with existing systems, while products for consumers might focus on user engagement and customer support. Knowing these dynamics helps create products that fit into the users’ daily routines and workflows.</p>
