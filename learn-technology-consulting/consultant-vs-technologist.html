    <h2>Being a Consultant (not just a technologist)</h2>
<h3>Understanding the role of a consultant</h3>
<p><strong>Beyond technical expertise:</strong> Recognize that your role extends beyond being a technical expert. As a consultant, you are a trusted advisor offering solutions that address real-world problems and deliver significant value.</p>
<p>This means your job is not only about solving technical issues but also understanding and addressing the client’s business challenges. You should aim to bridge the gap between technology and business, ensuring that your solutions contribute to the client’s success.</p>
<p><strong>Partnering with clients:</strong> View yourself as a partner, not just a service provider. Your aim is to collaborate closely with clients to achieve their business goals. This partnership involves building a strong relationship based on trust, open communication, and mutual respect, all of which will be covered in later sections.</p>
<p>By positioning yourself as a collaborator, you can better understand the client’s needs, align your efforts with their objectives, and create solutions that drive real value.</p>
<p><strong>Aligning with business strategy:</strong> Ensure your technical solutions align with the client’s broader business objectives and strategies. It is crucial to understand the client’s vision, mission, and strategic goals. This knowledge will guide your technical decisions and ensure that your contributions are not just technically sound but also strategically beneficial.</p>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Active listening:</strong> Practice active listening by summarizing client needs and concerns in your own words to ensure understanding.</li>
<li><strong>KPIs alignment:</strong> Work with your client to define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that measure the success of your solutions in business terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on a recent project. How did your role extend beyond providing technical expertise?</li>
<li>What strategies can you use to position yourself as a trusted advisor rather than just a service provider?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Delivering real value</h3>
<p><strong>Identifying needs:</strong> Proactively identify and prioritize client needs through ongoing communication and strategic meetings. Start by listening carefully and asking insightful questions to uncover underlying issues and opportunities.</p>
<p>How to assess impact and identify opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly review the impact of implemented solutions and identify new opportunities for adding value. Assess how your solutions are performing and whether they meet the client’s expectations.</li>
<li>Use tools like SWOT analysis, customer journey mapping, and the Value Proposition Canvas to uncover deeper client needs. These tools can help you identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, as well as map out the client’s journey and value propositions.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to provide educational leadership:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep clients informed about industry trends and innovations. Share relevant articles, reports, and insights that can help them stay ahead in their industry.</li>
<li>Use case studies to illustrate successful projects and highlight tangible benefits. Showcase examples of how similar solutions have benefitted other clients, emphasizing the positive outcomes and lessons learned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client Interviews:</strong> Conduct structured interviews with key stakeholders to uncover pain points and priorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you proactively identify and prioritize client needs?</li>
<li>How do you measure the impact of your solutions and identify new opportunities for adding value?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advocating for best practices</h3>
<p><strong>Lead by example:</strong> Demonstrate best practices in your own work. This not only improves the product but can also be a reference to share what implementing best practices looks like.</p>
<p>By holding yourself to a high standard in your own work, you set a benchmark for quality and excellence that your team can aspire to.</p>
<p><strong>Guide clients:</strong> Help clients understand the rationale behind your recommendations, making them advocates for best practices. Explain the benefits of following best practices and how they can positively impact the project and business outcomes.</p>
<p>How to offer strategic advisory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the client’s current tech setup and suggest updates to better meet project needs and support growth. Conduct thorough assessments and provide clear, actionable recommendations.</li>
<li>Create proofs of concept to demonstrate how different technologies perform under specific conditions. This helps your client visualize potential solutions and make informed decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conduct education sessions:</strong> Hold sessions to update clients on the latest in technologies and best practices, showing how these can benefit their business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you demonstrate best practices in your work?</li>
<li>Describe a situation where you had to guide a client to understand the rationale behind your recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flexibility in problem solving</h3>
<p><strong>Adapting solutions:</strong> Stay adaptable, ready to adjust solutions as needed, and creatively tackle problems using methods like brainstorming or the Five Whys. Flexibility is key in consulting, as client needs and project scopes will inevitably change unexpectedly.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering clients:</strong> Provide clients with the tools and understanding needed to actively participate in the technical process, enhancing their decision-making capabilities. Offer training and resources that enable clients to take a more active role in their projects.</p>
<p><strong>Thinking holistically:</strong> Consider the big picture, understanding how different parts of a system interact and affect the business. Evaluate the interdependencies and potential ripple effects of your solutions, ensuring they align with the client’s overall strategy.</p>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge transfer sessions:</strong> Hold knowledge transfer meetings where you train your client on tools and processes, empowering them to take ownership.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe a time when you had to adjust your solution to better meet your client’s needs.</li>
<li>What techniques do you use to empower your client to actively participate in the design, management, or technical process?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Managing scope, timeline, and risks</h3>
<p>Effectively manage project boundaries and expectations to avoid scope creep and ensure successful outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly document project scopes in detail. Use project charters, scope statements, and detailed plans to define the project’s boundaries.</li>
<li>Use formal processes to handle scope changes, always with client approval. Establish change control procedures to manage and approve any alterations to the project scope.</li>
<li>Regularly explain the impact of scope changes to the client. Communicate the implications of any changes on the project’s timeline, budget, and outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to proactively manage risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify potential risks early and develop mitigation strategies. Use risk management techniques such as risk assessments and contingency planning.</li>
<li>Conduct regular risk assessments and update mitigation plans as necessary. Continuously monitor and reassess risks throughout the project lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of issues and challenges on projects as opportunities to show problem-solving skills and the value you can provide to clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use problem-solving frameworks and issue tracking tools to stay on top of challenges. Tools like root cause analysis and issue logs can help manage and resolve problems systematically.</li>
<li>After resolving any crisis, review what happened with your team to prevent future issues. Conduct post-mortem analyses and implement lessons learned to improve future performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change request process:</strong> Implement a formal change request process to manage and document any alterations to the project scope.</li>
<li><strong>Root Cause Analysis (RCA):</strong> Use root cause analysis techniques (e.g. Five Whys) to identify and address the underlying causes of issues.</li>
<li><strong>Post-mortem reviews:</strong> Conduct post-mortem reviews after major issues to learn from them and prevent recurrence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you describe a situation where you successfully managed scope changes?</li>
<li>What strategies do you use to proactively manage risks in a project?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upholding ethics and professionalism</h3>
<p><strong>Maintaining confidentiality and integrity:</strong> Handle sensitive information with care and maintain the highest level of professionalism. Ensure that client data and intellectual property are protected and handled ethically.</p>
<p><strong>Committing to ethical standards:</strong> Adhere to the highest ethical standards in every action and decision, building trust and credibility with clients. Be transparent, honest, and accountable in all your dealings, reinforcing the client’s confidence in your integrity.</p>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you provide an example of how you adhered to ethical standards in a challenging situation?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understanding the client</h2>
<p>When starting work on a new project, there are a few different parts of the entire project that you should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Client:</strong> This refers to the company you’re working with, including their industry, operations, market position, and strategic goals. Understanding the client involves knowing their business model, organizational structure, and key decision-makers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Product:</strong> The software applications or services provided to end-users. This includes the features, functionalities, and the value proposition of the product. Knowing the product thoroughly helps in identifying areas for improvement and innovation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Customer:</strong> The end-users who interact with the software. Understanding their needs, preferences, and pain points is crucial for delivering a product that meets or exceeds expectations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Project:</strong> The client’s goals to enhance the software to better meet customer needs and drive business success. This encompasses the project’s scope, objectives, timelines, and deliverables.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A deep understanding of the client is fundamental to effective consulting. In this section, we’ll dig into understanding the client you’re working with.</p>
<h3>Joining a new project with a Bitovi Principal</h3>
<p>Consultants should be equipped with a comprehensive understanding of the project’s context:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Clear vision, challenges, and expectations:</strong> Get a detailed briefing from key stakeholders about the project vision, the specific challenges faced, and the expectations for the consultant’s role and contributions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business requirements and technical specifications:</strong> Obtain detailed documentation outlining the business requirements, technical specifications, and any relevant historical context of the project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SWOT analysis:</strong> Conduct a SWOT analysis to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the client’s product. This helps in forming a strategic approach to the project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Client’s strategies:</strong> Gain insight into the client’s past and current strategies. This includes understanding previous initiatives, successes, failures, and lessons learned.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these elements are missing, the Principal or Consultant should take proactive steps to gather this information.</p>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meet with key stakeholders:</strong> Having a conversation with the key stakeholders on your project will show them you’re interested in building a relationship and give you an opportunity to learn from them.</li>
<li><strong>Ask clarifying questions:</strong> Don’t hesitate to ask for clarification on any point that seems unclear. It’s better to ask questions early than to make incorrect assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the client’s main business goals, and how does this project align with them?</li>
<li>What are the specific pain points the client is facing with this project?</li>
<li>How will success be measured for this project?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conducting background research</h3>
<p>Thorough background research is useful for understanding the client’s context and preparing for effective engagement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Company history:</strong> Dive into sources such as the client’s website, Wikipedia page, and recent news articles to gather a comprehensive history of the company. Understand their milestones, key achievements, and significant changes over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check LinkedIn:</strong> Review the LinkedIn profiles of the people you will be working with to understand their professional backgrounds and any shared connections or common experiences. For example, discovering shared educational backgrounds can serve as icebreakers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prepare thoroughly:</strong> Approach this research with the same diligence as preparing for a job interview. Being well-informed about the client demonstrates professionalism and builds credibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Industry insight:</strong> Subscribe to industry newsletters and follow relevant publications to stay updated on trends and developments. For example, if consulting for a quick-service restaurant, reading articles from QSR Magazine can provide valuable industry insights.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document learnings:</strong> Share what you learn with other teammates by creating a document and contributing to it over time.</li>
<li><strong>Personal connections:</strong> Leverage any personal connections or network contacts for insider perspectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>What significant changes has your client’s company undergone in recent years?</li>
<li>Are there any recent news articles or industry reports that could impact your client’s business?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Analyzing competitors</h3>
<p>Generally, the client should be responsible for determining where they stand in the competitive landscape.</p>
<p>However, some startups or young businesses may need help in figuring out who they are! In this case, conducting in-depth competitor research helps in understanding the client’s market position and identifying opportunities for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use reliable sources:</strong> Explore competitors through reliable sources such as Bloomberg, CNBC, or industry-specific outlets. These sources provide credible and comprehensive information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collect market data:</strong> Gather information from industry reports, market analyses, and trade journals. This data provides a macro view of market trends and dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyze digital presence:</strong> Use tools like Google Analytics and SEMrush to assess competitors’ online performance. This includes website traffic, keyword rankings, and digital marketing strategies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply frameworks:</strong> Use frameworks like Porter’s Five Forces and PESTEL to analyze the competitive environment. These tools help in understanding the external factors impacting the client’s business.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benchmark KPIs:</strong> Compare the client’s performance against industry standards and top competitors. This benchmarking identifies areas where the client excels or needs improvement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SWOT for competitors:</strong> Perform SWOT analyses for major competitors.</li>
<li><strong>Practical exercises:</strong> Run through hypothetical scenarios using frameworks like Porter’s Five Forces and PESTEL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are the client’s main competitors, and what are their strengths and weaknesses?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Continuous strategy improvement</h3>
<p>Staying current and adapting strategies based on ongoing insights is useful for sustained success:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand company drivers:</strong> Recognize the factors driving the client’s business, such as corporate culture, mission, and strategic priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Follow trends:</strong> Keep up with technological and industry developments by reading journals, blogs, and attending conferences. This helps in anticipating changes and staying ahead of the curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RSS feeds:</strong> Use RSS feeds to aggregate content from industry blogs and journals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Client questions</h3>
<p>Understanding the client:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the core business or primary mission of the client?</li>
<li>What are the key products or services offered by the client?</li>
<li>Who are the client’s primary target customers or audience?</li>
