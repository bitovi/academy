    <h2>Setting Expectations</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Results - Expectations = Performance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most basic consulting maxim is to exceed expectations. To say this another way, the best way to get your client to love you is to set low expectations and wildly exceed them. In reality, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be careful to never over promise, especially when there are external dependencies or unknowns</li>
<li>Pad estimates to account for external dependencies and unknowns</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Consulting Trifecta</h2>
<p><img src="../static/img/technology-consulting/goodfastcheap.png" alt="Good fast cheap" width="640px"/></p>
<p>You may have heard the following maxim: cheap, fast, good… pick two. While this may be useful (and true) for sales discussions, a more useful variation for project planning is:</p>
<p>Scope, schedule, resources… pick two.</p>
<p>This means that any project lead or PM can “fix”:</p>
<ul>
<li>the scope and number of resources is fixed, the schedule must be variable</li>
<li>the number of resources and schedule is fixed, the scope must be variable</li>
<li>the scope and schedule is fixed, the number of resources must be variable</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of a project as a balloon with three edges. If you squeeze two edges, the third must expand. If you squeeze all three edges, the balloon will pop.</p>
<p>Bad or inexperienced project managers will attempt to tell you that all three factors are already set, and we must “work harder” to meet expectations. This is a trap and we must push back immediately or we’ll be setting ourselves up for failure. No matter how small the project, there must be an opportunity at the start for the team to set at least one of these factors.</p>
<h2>Pushing back</h2>
<p>Inexperienced consultants tend to be pushovers and think of project constraints as fixed and unchangeable.</p>
<p>Experienced consultants recognize that nothing in a project is truly unchangeable. The key to their success is identifying the largest problems standing in the way of the project success and pushing back on them, as hard as necessary.</p>
<h3>Identifying unreasonable expectations</h3>
<p>Understanding and identifying unreasonable expectations is the first step in managing client demands.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defining unreasonable expectations:</strong> Unreasonable expectations often stem from insufficient resources, technological limitations, or clients demanding more work than is feasible within a given timeframe. For example, a client may request a complete overhaul of their system within a month, which would typically require several months of dedicated effort.</li>
<li><strong>Recognizing the signs:</strong> Compare the client’s requests with past project experiences and your current team’s capabilities. If a request significantly exceeds these, it likely falls into the unreasonable category. For instance, expecting a feature-rich application from a two-person team in a few weeks when it usually takes a larger team several months is a clear sign.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a checklist:</strong> Develop a checklist of factors that typically indicate unrealistic expectations, such as tight deadlines, budget constraints, and resource limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Scenario analysis:</strong> Run “what-if” scenarios to see the impact of client demands on project timelines and resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you differentiate between a challenging request and an unreasonable one? What criteria do you use?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Effective communication techniques</h3>
<p>Clear and effective communication is essential to address and manage client expectations appropriately.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be transparent and direct:</strong> Always convey what your team can realistically achieve. Avoid overpromising to please the client initially. For example, if a client asks for a complex feature that requires six months, explain why it’s not possible to deliver it in three.</li>
<li><strong>Support with evidence:</strong> Use data and past project experiences to justify your stance. For instance, create estimates for the individual pieces of work to show how they exceed the expected timeline.</li>
<li><strong>Practice active listening:</strong> Understand the client’s underlying needs by listening empathetically. This helps in addressing their core requirements even if their initial requests are unrealistic. For instance, a client asking for a rapid deployment might be worried about market competition, which you can address by proposing a phased release.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summarize and validate:</strong> Summarize what the client said and validate their concerns before presenting your counterpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Use “I” statements:</strong> Frame your responses with “I” statements to express concerns without sounding accusatory (e.g., “I feel that this timeline might not be achievable because…”).</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you ensure clarity when explaining to a client why their request cannot be met?</li>
<li>What strategies do you use to gather and present evidence that supports your position?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategic negotiation tactics</h3>
<p>Negotiation is key to aligning client expectations with project realities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set firm boundaries:</strong> Clearly define what is achievable with the current resources. State these boundaries upfront to avoid misunderstandings later. For example, “Our team can deliver this module by the end of Q2, but not the entire project.”</li>
<li><strong>Propose viable alternatives:</strong> Offer realistic options that align with the client’s objectives. If a client wants a complex feature quickly, suggest developing a simpler MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first.</li>
<li><strong>Break the project into phases:</strong> Phased-base agreements allow for periodic reassessment and adjustment of expectations. This can also help in delivering incremental value to the client, making the progress tangible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you establish boundaries without damaging the client relationship?</li>
<li>Can you recall a time when proposing alternatives led to a successful negotiation? What alternatives did you offer?</li>
<li>What are the benefits of using phase-based agreements in managing client expectations?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Robust project management practices</h3>
<p>Strong project management practices are essential for maintaining realistic expectations and delivering on commitments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain scope integrity:</strong> Regularly review the project scope to ensure alignment with the agreed terms. For example, use scope documents and change request logs to manage additions or modifications.</li>
<li><strong>Proactive risk management:</strong> Identify potential risks from the onset and develop mitigation strategies. For instance, if a particular technology is new to the team, allocate extra time for training and potential troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekly check-ins:</strong> Schedule regular check-ins to monitor scope and resource allocation, ensuring alignment with the project plan.</li>
<li><strong>Task prioritization:</strong> Use tools like the Eisenhower Matrix to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.</li>
<li><strong>Contingency planning:</strong> Develop contingency plans for critical project risks and ensure the team knows how to implement them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you ensure the project scope remains aligned with client agreements?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Influencing and persuasion skills</h3>
<p>Being able to influence and persuade clients is vital for successful expectation management.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guide the conversation:</strong> Frame your feedback in a way that emphasizes achieving the best possible project outcome. For instance, “To ensure we deliver a robust and high-quality product, we recommend extending the timeline by two weeks.”</li>
<li><strong>Build and leverage credibility:</strong> Use your experience and past project successes to support your perspectives on feasibility. Highlighting your expertise can build trust and make clients more receptive to your recommendations.</li>
<li><strong>Foster consensus:</strong> Use regular meetings or workshops to align all stakeholders and achieve mutual understanding. Consensus helps in ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding project scope and timelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Use storytelling to make your points more relatable and compelling, sharing relevant past successes and challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Ethos, Pathos, Logos:</strong> Structure your arguments around credibility (ethos), emotional appeal (pathos), and logical reasoning (logos).</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>In what ways can guiding the conversation help achieve better project outcomes?</li>
<li>How do you foster consensus among stakeholders with differing priorities?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documenting agreements and changes</h3>
<p>Proper documentation is essential for managing and communicating expectations clearly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain change logs:</strong> Record any changes in project scope or expectations. This ensures that everyone is aware of what has been agreed upon.</li>
<li><strong>Regular updates:</strong> Provide frequent updates to keep everyone informed about progress and any changes in expectations. This can be done through weekly status reports or regular client meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meeting minutes:</strong> Keep detailed meeting minutes and distribute them to all stakeholders to ensure everyone is on the same page.</li>
<li><strong>Change request forms:</strong> Implement formal change request forms to document any changes in project scope or expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you ensure all changes in project scope are accurately documented?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p><strong>Project planning:</strong> Your client informs you that your team will be working on a new feature for your project. They’ve committed to an internal deadline of July 1st, with a non-negotiable set of requirements, and you have a team of yourself and 2 devs to deliver.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do?</strong></p>
<p><details>
<summary>
Answer
</summary></p>
<p>Let them know that plan is likely untenable, and that you’d like to evaluate the scope before committing to that deadline (otherwise there’s risk in not meeting it). Work with them to find a scope that keeps them within their time and staffing constraints. If they are not flexible, explain the scope-resources-deadline trifecta and the risks. Ask them to consider additional resources, or a more flexible deadline.</p>

<li>Pushing Back</li>
</ul>
<p></details></p>
<h2>Balancing progress and oversight</h2>
<p>There will always be a tradeoff between moving a project forward and getting sign-off from a client or stakeholder. You may often deal with clients who say they want to be involved in many layers of decisions but they are so busy or non-responsive that progress becomes blocked waiting for their approvals.</p>
<p>We’ve found the best practice for balancing these concerns is to optimize for progress, but give stakeholders plenty of opportunities to weigh in or course correct. In other words, in most cases, move forward with your best judgement, but visibly document your course via emails or tickets, in a way where clients can step in if they desire.</p>
<h3>Get to know the stakeholders</h3>
<p>Understanding your stakeholders is the foundation of effective project management. It involves identifying who they are, assessing their influence, and establishing communication channels tailored to their needs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify key stakeholders:</strong> Start by identifying the primary stakeholders involved in the project. These are the individuals or groups who have a vested interest in the project’s outcome. Examples include clients, project sponsors, team members, and end-users.</li>
<li><strong>Assess stakeholder influence:</strong> Determine the level of influence each stakeholder has on the project. This includes understanding their authority to make decisions, their interest in the project, and their impact on its success. Use tools like stakeholder maps to visualize and assess these dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Establish communication channels:</strong> Set up clear and effective communication channels. Decide on the frequency and method of communication for each stakeholder based on their influence and interest. For example, high-influence stakeholders might need weekly updates via video calls, while others might prefer bi-weekly email summaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conduct stakeholder interviews:</strong> Schedule one-on-one interviews with key stakeholders to understand their priorities, expectations, and concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on a previous project you were involved in. Who were the key stakeholders, and how did their influence and interest affect the project?</li>
<li>How do you establish trust and rapport with new stakeholders?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keep everyone informed</h3>
<p>Keeping stakeholders informed is crucial to maintaining their trust and engagement. A well-structured communication plan ensures that everyone is on the same page.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Develop a communication plan:</strong> Create a detailed communication plan that outlines what information will be shared, when, how, and with whom. This plan should address the needs of all stakeholders and ensure transparency throughout the project lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Provide regular updates:</strong> Regularly update stakeholders through various channels such as meetings, emails, and reports. These updates should highlight progress, upcoming milestones, and any potential issues.</li>
<li><strong>Tailor communication styles:</strong> Adapt your communication style to suit the preferences of different stakeholders. For example, some stakeholders might prefer detailed reports, while others might prefer concise summaries or visual presentations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Templates and formats:</strong> Use standardized templates for reports and updates to maintain consistency and clarity in communication.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly summary emails:</strong> Send out weekly summary emails highlighting key achievements, upcoming tasks, and any issues needing attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about a project where communication broke down. What were the consequences, and how could they have been avoided?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Involve stakeholders consistently</h3>
<p>Consistent involvement of stakeholders helps in building a collaborative environment and ensures that their insights and feedback are incorporated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schedule review sessions:</strong> Set up regular review sessions to discuss progress and gather feedback. These sessions can be weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly depending on the project’s needs and the stakeholders’ availability.</li>
<li><strong>Engage in decision-making:</strong> Include stakeholders in decision-making processes, especially when significant changes are being considered. This inclusion fosters a sense of ownership and aligns the project with their expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Address concerns:</strong> Provide stakeholders with opportunities to voice their concerns and suggestions. Address these promptly to prevent minor issues from becoming major roadblocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular check-ins:</strong> Set up bi-weekly or monthly check-ins with stakeholders to review progress and gather feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Structured agendas:</strong> Prepare structured agendas for review sessions to ensure focused and productive discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you balance involving stakeholders in decision-making without slowing down project progress?</li>
<li>Describe a time when stakeholder feedback led to a significant change in a project. How did you handle the change?</li>
<li>What strategies do you use to encourage stakeholder participation in review sessions?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Manage expectations while progressing</h3>
<p>Effectively managing expectations helps in maintaining stakeholder satisfaction while ensuring the project progresses smoothly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prioritize tasks:</strong> Prioritize tasks based on their importance and impact on the project timeline. Allocate resources efficiently to ensure critical tasks are completed on time.</li>
<li><strong>Align with broader goals:</strong> Ensure that immediate tasks are aligned with the broader goals of the project. This alignment provides a clear direction and purpose, enhancing coherence and focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use priority matrices:</strong> Implement priority matrices to help prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency.</li>
<li><strong>Set clear boundaries:</strong> Clearly communicate what is feasible within the project scope and timelines to manage stakeholder expectations effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you prioritize tasks when resources are limited and deadlines are tight?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use technology to enhance oversight and tracking</h3>
<p>Leveraging technology enhances oversight and tracking, making it easier to manage projects efficiently and transparently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralize tracking:</strong> Use project management software to centralize the tracking of activities and communications. Tools like Jira can provide a single source of truth for the project’s progress.</li>
<li><strong>Use collaborative tools:</strong> Use collaborative tools like Microsoft Teams or Slack to facilitate efficient communication and collaboration. These tools help in keeping everyone in the loop and enable real-time updates.</li>
<li><strong>Set up dashboards:</strong> Create dashboards to monitor important metrics in real time. Dashboards provide a visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and help in identifying trends and issues quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>What key metrics do you track using dashboards, and how do they inform your project management decisions?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<h4>The unresponsive client</h4>
<p>You’re in charge of adding a search box to a component. You could build it into the existing grid in a completely abstract way, which would take 5 days, or you could make it work in the way needed for this specific use case, which would take two days. You ask your client which they would prefer but they are in two days of meetings and not replying promptly. This is the most important feature right now, so switching to something else isn’t a viable option.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do?</strong></p>
<p><details>
<summary>
Answer
</summary></p>
<p>How likely is it that the project will reuse the search feature in a future grid? For example, assume, based on your current knowledge, there’s a less than 25% chance of reuse. Therefore, I would recommend choosing the non-abstract approach, and writing an email, or writing a comment on the ticket tagging your client which summarizes your decision, the reasons for it, and states “I will proceed with this approach, but let me know if you disagree”. Forward progress is being made, but with transparency and giving your client the opportunity to course correct if they have different information.</p>
<p>Principals used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balancing progress and oversight</li>
</ul>
<p></details></p>
<h4>The difficult developer</h4>
<p>There is one particularly grumpy client developer that joins your team in the middle of the project. Every idea you propose they argue against. They tend to nitpick all your pull requests with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">bikeshed-type</a> comments. Recently, they proposed that we rewrite our project in Angular because it’s easier to onboard new developers to a popular framework.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do?</strong></p>
<p><details>
<summary>
Answer
</summary></p>
<p>Reach out to the developer and try to get to know them better. Try to understand their concerns and be flexible when necessary. Do your best to communicate your position and find a way to work together. Remind the developer that you share the same goals, and that finding common ground will benefit everyone on the team.</p>
<p>Bring up your concerns during a team retrospective and try to develop consensus on the best approach. If all of that fails, work with the team lead and the client to mediate and identify the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>Principles used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that you share common goals</li>
<li>Building rapport</li>
<li>Pushing back</li>
</ul>
