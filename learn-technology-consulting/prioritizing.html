    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>There's <strong>a lot</strong> that goes into building, marketing, and selling a successful
technology product. Understanding the relative priorities of these activities
can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus your team on the most productive ways of adding value.</li>
<li>Help teams in one area appreciate the efforts of other teams.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that said, the following are the most important activities to get right (listed in order):</p>
<ol>
<li>Goals - Everyone should know what they are trying to accomplish.</li>
<li>Product Management - Processes add value to customers and work towards successful outcomes.</li>
<li>UX / Design - A user experience designed
to add value for customers.</li>
<li>Tools and Technology - Tools that support
efficient delivery of the above goals.</li>
</ol>
<p>While it might seem counterintuitive
that technology is the least important part of
technology delivery, the truth is, <strong>technology is the least important aspect of technology delivery</strong>.</p>
<p>How can this be? You might build a error-free,
highly performant, extremely maintainable (flexible) application quickly, but consider what happens
to that application if the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>has a <strong>terrible user experience</strong> - Users will be confused. The product will fail.</li>
<li>is <strong>managed poorly</strong> - Unless you are lucky enough to
get the application right on the first try, you will
be unable to respond to feedback and quickly iterate.
The product won't improve and eventually fail.</li>
<li>has <strong>misunderstood goals</strong> - Progress will be chaotic,
as team members work toward their own purposes.</li>
<li>has the <strong>wrong goals</strong> - Sometimes the product doesn't
fit the market. No amount of technology changes that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite all of this, technology choices are
<strong>very</strong> important. Applications are built on code after all.
A slow application negatively influences user experience. An inflexible application won't be able to change direction.</p>
<h2>Video Evidence</h2>
<p>In 2014, Bitovi performed a review of its clients against a
<a href="https://github.com/bitovi/checklist">checklist</a> of best practices. While far from scientific, the following video goes through the results:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/20ebllexvuc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>A short time to delivery most strongly indicated success.</li>
<li>It reaffirms the priorities listed above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Take Action</h2>
<p>If your product doesn't have:</p>
<ul>
<li>clear goals that create customer value</li>
<li>product management organized toward creating customer value</li>
<li>design and development tools and technology that
rapidly create customer value</li>
</ul>
<p>Then start working today to change this! Being on successful
projects is <em>sublime</em>.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;But wait!&quot;</strong>, you say, <strong>&quot;Easier said than done.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>There are likely many obstacles to change:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't have the authority to create change. You aren't the CEO,
partner, product owner, etc.</li>
<li>You don't have the information to recommend changes.</li>
<li>The culture isn't conducive to change and/or questioning authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>Change is hard. However, this guide includes
strategies for working through these obstacles. If these challenges
seem daunting, the first place
to start is the <a href="communication.html" title="Best practices for communicating with clients.">Communication</a>
guide. Effective communication is the foundation towards working through
working through these sort of obstacles.</p>
