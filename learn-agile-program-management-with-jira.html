							title="Learn how to recognize which work will take the longest, and ways to break things up.
Overview
It barely needs to be said that finding ways to deliver a product faster is a key aspect of business success. There are costs associated with not having a feature customers want, an efficiency improvement that internal users need, a delay in being first to market with a disruptive offering. An obvious way to achieve a shorter cycle is to find the longest “pole” in the schedule and break it up, finding ways to deliver it quicker.
Ways to Shorten the Long Pole
Increase resources
This option is the most obvious: if it takes a team of three developers 5 weeks to deliver a feature, shouldn’t it only take 3 weeks if you add two more developers? The improvement by adding people, however, is rarely linear in this way.
The primary reason why involves Brooks’s Law, put forth by IBM software engineer Fred Brooks in his book “The Mythical Man-Month”. Brooks states that the increase in team size leads to an exponential growth in communications channels which need to be maintained in order for the team to continue operating. Even if the technical aspects of the work can be done interchangeably by all team members (which is a very big big “if”), the n(n-1)/2 expansion of communication channels hampers the linear expectations of improved velocity.

There are also assumptions about how easy it is for new team members to onboard, learn about the work being done, and efficient adaptation to specific ways of working within the team.
Adding team members will almost always help the team’s overall velocity, especially if the technical skills of the new developers match what the team needs. But it’s important for a TPO to understand, and communicate to stakeholders, the improvement likely will not match expectations.
Technical Spikes to Improve Confidence
As we saw in the Estimating section, the log-normal distribution of a confidence factor can cause a huge blowup in delivery times. In this example, a 2-week estimate with low confidence has a longer timeline in the schedule than the high-confidence 3-week epic preceding it.

A short spike to investigate any open business or technical questions which are causing the 40% confidence in this example will shorten this total “pole” by several times the spike duration.

As a TPO, understanding why the developers are having concerns and questioning their confidence will allow you to identify what the spike should involve, what answers the team needs to complete it and how to prioritize its completion over other feature work or technical debt which could be done.
Remove Scope
If you have the right-sized team and the best confidence in your estimates, and you still have an obvious long pole, the simplest way to shorten it is to remove scope.
In this example, we have a circled long pole of functional dependency, going across multiple teams.

The last epic in this flow has dependencies on two other epics from two other teams. Can we remove it from the current scope and shorten the delivery cycle? It can always be picked up later.

The team’s ability to have this descoping discussion with stakeholders depends on a number of factors, notably time and risk sensitivity. Is a robust “what” more important to our application than an earlier “when”? Is the potential risk of an epic that relies on two other epics which come near the end of team delivery, both of which have their own dependence on an earlier epic, worth taking on?
We may also look to move requirements and/or use cases out-of-scope to shrink the size of one or more epics. In the Promotion Code example, let’s say the original requirements were to allow a promotion code to be applied to one item in the shopping cart, but not an item which is already on sale. If the decision is made to change the scope such that the code is applied to an entire order, we simplify and reduce the size of multiple epics:

Cart operation to add a promotion code (do not have to select an item in the cart)
Check with store to see if an item is listed at a sale price
Re-calculating the subtotal

Splitting Epics to Unblock and Parallelize
One of the best ways to address the long pole is to break epics up into smaller epics, and find ways to then split the work. Let’s go back to our original work plan, and pick a large epic with relatively low confidence, one that seems to be square in the middle of the key work dependencies.

In our Promotion Code example, this highlighted epic could cover:

Additional data related to a code for start &amp; end date ranges during which the code is valid
A check in the shopping cart to see if the current date falls within that range

The TPO and the team could choose to split those two features up into their own Epic.

Now the work for the first part, the dates added as part of a promotion code, has its own estimate &amp; confidence. This could be done in parallel with the first two epics, because it does not have dependencies on that work. The timing of delivery of the other half of the epic can also shift to the left.

The dependent epics also shift left, shortening the entire pole.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>In this training, you will learn how to <span class="color-blue bold">build</span>,
<span class="color-green bold">maintain</span>, and
<span class="color-purple bold">report</span> <span class="color-teal bold">accurate</span> and
<span class="color-red bold italic">actionable</span> <span class="color-gray bold">multi-team</span> plans with Jira. Let's break each part of that down:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="color-blue bold">Build</span> - How to take ideas, flesh them out, estimate them, and put them into future plans.</li>
<li><span class="color-green bold">Maintain</span> - How to keep a plan up to date as development completes and things change.</li>
<li><span class="color-purple bold">Report</span> - How to summarize the plan in an easy-to-digest format for stakeholders and a wider team.</li>
<li><span class="color-teal bold">Accurate</span> - How to use improved modeling of estimates to create more accurate plans.</li>
<li><span class="color-gray bold">Multi-team</span> - How to build plans that coordinates the work items for multiple product teams at a program level.</li>
</ul>
<p>This training will leave you with a solid understanding of Jira too. However, the ultimate goal of this training is to teach you how to create <span class="color-red bold italic">actionable</span> plans.</p>
<h2><span class="color-red bold">Actionable</span> Plans</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Know the future so that you can change it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone inspirational</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="color-red bold italic">Actionable Plans</span> are plans that have enough accuracy and forward visibility to enable teams to make changes that actually improve outcomes. These changes might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restructuring work to avoid blockers</li>
<li>Better coordinating handoff between teams</li>
<li>Changing scope</li>
<li>Exploring alternate solutions</li>
<li>Adding more resources</li>
</ul>
<p>We call this process “breaking the long poles”. First, you'll build a plan:</p>
<p><img src="../static/img/program-management-with-jira/home/identify-longpole.png"
class="content-400-800-shadow"/></p>
<p>And then identify areas are the most likely bottleneck delivery times:</p>
<p><img src="../static/img/program-management-with-jira/home/identified-longpole.png"
class="content-400-800-shadow"/></p>
<p>And be able to adjust plans to shorten the delivery time:</p>
<p><img src="../static/img/program-management-with-jira/home/shortened.png"
class="content-400-800-shadow"/></p>
<p>In this way, program managers can dramatically help delivery performance.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This training imagines you are managing “Itsy Bitsy Marketplace”, a simple eCommerce website that sells clothing and other items made from spider silk.</p>
<p><img src="../static/img/program-management-with-jira/home/itsy-homepage.png"

<p>You will learn more about the product in <a href="learn-agile-program-management-with-jira/product-overview.html" title="Learn to add things in the ideas backlog">Product Overview</a>.</p>
<p>You are tasked with taking one-sentence-long feature requests from Product Managers and turning feature requests into a fully developed product backlog, complete with actionable plans for successful delivery.</p>

<h2>A template, not a temple</h2>
<p>The processes and workflows discussed provided training have been used on multiple successful projects. However, this is just an example process and workflow. We always end up modifying the process and workflows to meet the needs of the teams and products. It’s a starter template for product teams to adapt to meet their needs.</p>
