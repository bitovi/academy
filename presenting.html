    <p>This guide is designed to walk you through the process of applying to a meetup or conference in a way that helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produce an engaging talk</li>
<li>Increase your chances of being accepted as a speaker</li>

    <h2>Why you should speak</h2>
<p>Speaking at conferences is a great way to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build your network</li>
<li>Develop communication skills</li>
<li>Become an expert</li>
<li>Help Bitovi's open source efforts</li>
<li>Make contacts for new client projects (QSLs and sales incentive bonus!)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>We strongly encourage people to speak. Bitovi can assist with things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time off to develop content and present</li>
<li>Design resources to style content</li>
<li>Bitovi swag to take and hand out</li>
<li>Travel and accommodation expenses*</li>
</ul>
<p>How much Bitovi will assist you is determined on a case-by-case basis and depends on things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of travel and accommodation*</li>
<li>The prestige and attendance of the conference</li>
<li>The topic (the more it helps Bitovi directly the better)</li>
<li>How much time off is required to prepare and attend</li>
</ul>
<p>&lowast; most <em>good</em> conferences cover travel expenses</p>
<h3>Developers</h3>
<p>You're <em>automatically approved</em> for talks where the event covers speaker costs and you are talking about Bitovi's open source or delivery efforts. Bitovi will also provide at least one <em>paid</em> day to develop content as well as <em>paid</em> days for the conference and travel time.</p>
<p>For events that don't cover speaker costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Day Training Events
<ul>
<li>In the US: Full Reimbursement</li>
<li>Outside the US: 1/2 reimbursement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Meetup or Conference Talk
<ul>
<li>In the US: 1/2 reimbursement</li>
<li>Outside the US: 1/4 reimbursement</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Designers</h3>
<p>Conferences, topics, and situations will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Please ask. We want to help you get out there.</p>
<h3>Bitcentive</h3>
<p>Topics that benefit our OS tools will be pointed and added to Bitcentive.</p>
<h2>Choosing a topic</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/donejs/donejs/blob/master/docs/guides/presentations.md">presentations list</a> is our exhaustive index of materials for conference and meetup talks. It includes both talks that are already prepared as well as presentation ideas that we’d like to flesh out. These are the easiest presentations to give.</p>
<p>You’re not limited to the topics we’ve already started working on. If you have a new idea, brainstorm it with Justin and we’ll work with you to develop a good description and presentation.</p>
<h2>Finding Conferences and Meetups</h2>

</blockquote>
<h3>Meetup Talk Request</h3>
<p>A meetup talk request is a short note to the organizers letting them know you are
interested in speaking and a brief idea about the topic.</p>
<p>See the examples below.</p>
<h4>CanJS example</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello {{ORGANIZER NAME}},</p>
<p>I am part of the team that builds and maintains CanJS[1]. It’s a collection of libraries that make it easy to build real-time web applications. Would you be interested in a talk where I walk people through one of its getting started guides[2] and build an example chat application? If so, I’d love to give one.</p>
<p>Thanks,
{{YOUR NAME}}</p>
<p>[1] https://canjs.com/
[2] https://canjs.com/doc/guides/chat.html</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>DoneJS example</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello {{ORGANIZER NAME}},</p>
<p>I am part of the team that builds and maintains DoneJS[1]. It’s a framework that makes it easy to build real-time web, mobile, and desktop applications. Would you be interested in a talk where I walk people through its quick start guide[2] and build an example chat application? If so, I’d love to give one.</p>
<p>Thanks,
{{YOUR NAME}}</p>
<p>[1] https://donejs.com/
[2] https://donejs.com/Guide.html</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Contact co-organizer</h4>
<p>If the main organizer doesn’t respond, you might want to contact one of the co-organizers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello {{ORGANIZER NAME}},</p>
<p>I am part of the team that builds and maintains DoneJS[1]. It’s a framework that makes it easy to build real-time web, mobile, and desktop applications.</p>
<p>I tried to contact your co-organizer through the group page but hadn’t heard a response, so I thought I’d shoot you a message. If you’re interested in a talk where I walk people through the DoneJS quick start guide[2] and build an example chat application, I’d love to give one.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration,
{{YOUR NAME}}</p>
<p>[1] https://donejs.com/
[2] https://donejs.com/Guide.html</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Follow up (nothing upcoming in the group’s calendar)</h4>
<p>When you haven’t heard back from an organizer and you want to send them another message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>It looks like you don’t have anything upcoming on the calendar right now. Would you be interested in setting something up soon?</p>
<p>Best,
{{YOUR NAME}}</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Follow up (group looks inactive)</h4>
<p>When you haven’t heard back from an organizer and you want to send them another message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I know your group hasn’t met in a while but I was wondering if you’d be up for an event sometime soon. Let me know if you’re interested and we’ll set something up!</p>
<p>Best,
{{YOUR NAME}}</p>
</blockquote>
