@typedef {{}} steal-tools.BuildOptions BuildOptions
@parent steal-tools.types

Options used to configure the build process.

@option {Boolean|Function} [minify=true] 

**Boolean**

Sets whether the source code is minified prior to writing.

Minification is optional but on by default, you can turn it off by doing:

```javascript
stealtools.build(config, {
	minify: false
});
```
---
**Function**

A function can be provided to handle minification of each file in a bundle, e.g:

```javascript
stealTools.build(config, {
	minify: function(source, options) {
		// use your own library to minify source.code 
		source.code = doCustomMinification(source.code);

		// return the source object when minification is complete
		return source;
	}
});
```

The function takes a `source` object as the first parameter, this object contains the `code` and its AST version after the transpilation
process; the second parameter, `options`, is the [steal-tools.BuildOptions] object passed to configure the build process.

@option {Boolean} [bundleSteal=false] Sets whether StealJS will be included in the built file. Enabling this option will allow you to limit the initial request to just one script.

@option {Boolean} [verbose=false] `true` turns on verbose output. Defaults to `false`.

@option {Boolean} [quiet=false] No logging.  Defaults to `false`.

@option {String} [dest="dist"] Specifies the destination folder for the build. By default steal-tools will write to the `BASEURL + '/dist'` folder where BASEURL is the local Steal [config.baseURL baseURL], usually the same folder that your package.json is located.

  The path can be specified in three ways:

 - Absolute path - dest starts with `/`, or matches _/^\w+:[\/\\]/_, like:  `__dirname+"/place"`, or `"c:\my\bundles"`.
 - Relative to `process.cwd()` - dest starts with `./`, like `"./place"`.
 - Relative to [config.baseURL baseURL] - dest looks like: "packages", "foo/bar".

@option {steal-tools.BundleAssetsOptions|Boolean} [bundleAssets=false] Set to true to have assets from your project bundled into your dest folder.

@option {Array.<moduleName>} ignore An array of module names that should be ignored and not included in the bundled file. 
For more information take a look at the `ignore` usage http://stealjs.com/docs/steal-tools.build.html#ignore


@option {Number} [maxBundleRequests=3] The maximum number of bundles that need to be loaded
for any `bundle` module. Defaults to `3`.

@option {Number} [maxMainRequests=3] The maximum number of bundles that will be loaded for any `main`
module. Defaults to `3`.

@option {Boolean} [removeDevelopmentCode=true] Remove any development code from the bundle specified 
using `//!steal-remove-start`, and `//!steal-remove-end` comments.

@option {Object} [cleanCSSOptions] A hash of options to customize the minification of css files. 
All available options are listed in the [clean-css documentation](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css#how-to-use-clean-css-programmatically).

@option {Object} [uglifyOptions] A hash of options to customize the minification of JavaScript files. StealTools uses the 
top-level `minify` function of uglify-js, and the available options are listed [here](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2#minify-options).

For example, to not uglify function names you can use [keep_fnames option](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2#mangle-options):

```javascript
stealTools.build(config, {
  uglifyOptions: {
    mangle: { "keep_fnames": true }
  }
});
```

@option {Boolean} [sourceMaps=false] Generate source maps alongside your bundles.

@option {Boolean} [sourceMapsContent=false] Include the original source contents in the generated source maps. Use this option if your production environment doesn't have access to the source files. Will result in a larger source maps size but will cause fewer requests.

@option {steal-tools.BuildOptions.transpile} [transpile] A function that handles the transpiling of ES6 source to a format for production.

@option {Boolean} [watch=false] Actives watch mode which will continuously build as you develop your application.

@option {Boolean} [envify=false] Replace Node-style environment variables with plain strings.

steal-tools uses [loose-envify](https://github.com/zertosh/loose-envify) under the hood, this option is specially useful when building React.js applications.

Usage:

First, make sure `NODE_ENV` is set appropiately, then just turn on the envify option;
if you're using the steal-tools CLI modify your build command to look like:

```
NODE_ENV=production steal-tools build --envify
```

or, if you're using the build API just pass the option like this:

```javascript
stealTools.build({}, {
	envify: true
});
```

@option {Boolean} [splitLoader=false] Writes the optimized loader in its own bundle.

By default the, [steal-tools.optimize] will add the loader code to the main bundle, if `splitLoader` is set to true, a bundle called `loader.js` will be created; in order to load the application the loader has to be loaded
like any other bundle.

```html
<script src="./dist/bundles/loader.js" async></script>
<script src="./dist/bundles/my-app.js" async></script>
```

> This option is only available for the [steal-tools.optimize] command.

@option {String|Array.<String>} [target] Specifies the platform where the application is going to be deployed.

Usage:

```js
stealTools.optimize({}, { 
  target: "node"
});
```

Setting target to `node` makes the loader suitable to run on Node.js environments (`require` is used to load bundles instead of script tags); currently the targets supported are: `node`, `web`, and `worker` (Web Workers).

Multiple targets can be set by passing an array of supported targets, e.g:

```js
stealTools.optimize({}, { 
  target: ["node", "web"]
});
```

When `target` is not set the bundle will be written out to its default location (See `dest` property above), but when single or multiple targets are provided, the build assets will be written out inside folders matching the target name.

For example, a build targeting both node and web will look like the tree below:

```
├── dist
    │   └── bundles
    │       ├── node
    │       │   └── (... application assets)
    │       └── web
    │           └── (... application assets)
```

> This option is only available for the [steal-tools.optimize] command.

@option {Boolean|String} [bundleManifest=false] Generates an HTTP2-push like manifest of the application bundles for server-side preload.

When set to `true` a `bundles.json` file will be written at the top level of the folder where the built assets are located (see the property`dest` above). 

A full path to the desired JSON filename can be provided, too. e.g:

```js
stealTools.build(config, { 
  bundleManifest: path.join(__dirname, "dist", "my-manifest.json")
});
```

The manifest has the following shape:

```json
{
  "[ENTRY-POINT-BUNDLE-NAME]": {
    "[SHARED-BUNDLE-NAME]": {
      "type": "style",
      "weight": 1
    },
    "[SHARED-BUNDLE-NAME]": {
      "type": "script",
      "weight": 2
    }
  }
}
```

The top-level objects correspond to _entry level bundles_; these are the bundles needed to start up individual "pages" of the application and  progressively loaded bundles.

The nested objects are _shared bundles_, these are created by `steal-tools` to minimize the number of HTTP requests needed to load the application code. 

Each _shared bundle_ has two properties, `type`, an string that indicates whether the bundle contains script code or styles and `weight`, a number indicating loading priority; a bundle with lower weight should be loaded before other bundles, e.g: style bundles have `weight` of `1` and should be loaded before script bundles.

@option {Boolean} [bundlePromisePolyfill=true] Bundles a Promise polyfill with StealJS core

By default, [steal-tools.build] will add a Promise polyfill as part of the StealJS core. If Promises are supported natively in the target environment of your application
you can turn this flag off to prevent the polyfill to be included, like this:

```js
stealTools.build(config, {
	bundlePromisePolyfill: false
});
```

steal-tools will write a file called `steal.sans-promises.production.js` to the bundles folder, make sure the script tag in your main html page loads the correct file, e.g:


```html
<script src="./dist/steal.sans-promises.production.js"></script>
```

The `bundlePromisePolyfill` also changes the default behavior of [bundleSteal], meaning that
the Promise polyfill will be excluded from StealJS core regardless of whether it is part of the main bundle or not.

To bundle StealJS without the Promise polyfill just pass the following options to [steal-tools.build]:


```js
stealTools.build(config, {
	bundleSteal: true,
	bundlePromisePolyfill: false
});
```
